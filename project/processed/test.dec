I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
What good stuff?
I hope so.
You might wanna think about it
Hi, Joey.
But you hate Joey
As in...
Why didn't you tell me?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Exactly my point
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Just sent 'em through.
I was kidding. People actually live there?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
It's a lung cancer issue
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Where?
Nope - just came by to chat
We don't chat.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
That's never been proven
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Sure, I do
What?
Busy
Maybe.
No, you weren't
Why'd you lie?
Pleasant?
Look up, sunshine
Good call.
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
Fallacy.
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
Enough!
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
Right.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
Did I have anything to say about it?
We'll all go crazy...
Yes, your Eminence.  The voyage should not take more than six or seven weeks.
Did He not choose a carpenter's son to reveal Himself to the world?
Indeed.  The world is full of mercenaries -- and states often make use of them, when it benefits them.  My only concern is the welfare and prosperity of Spain.
On the contrary, Your Eminence.  It seems to me the man is preparing his own cross.
A waste...?  Let me tell you something, Arojaz.  If your name, or mine, is ever remembered -- it will only be because of his.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Yes... I remember...
Appointment to what?
I am not a seaman.  But I heard it is no more than a week at sea.  I hope you are not too disappointed.
I'm not bargaining!
Roofs... towers, palaces... spires...
That's what it says.
Father Marchena!
Colon!  Don't!
What are you saying?
I knew you would.
I don't know... I have the impression that I didn't change that much.  I still can't accept the world as it is!
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
We don't need to know.
Savagery is what monkeys understand.
And what do you think Mendez?
Twenty eight.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You're right.  Let the men decide.
Yes, Your Majesty.
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Because he is not afraid of me.
Yes.  Yes, come with me!
What about Oleg?
Yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. She went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
Out on my back when I was a small boy.
I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture.
No.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
I'm glad I met you.
In the kitchen.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you?
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
No!  Nothing happened.
Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
Yeah.  He finished awhile ago.
Maybe you could just put in a shot of Martell?
When?
Takin' a bath.
Yeah.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
No.
Did you tell him you did?
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
This has nothing to do with your fire.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
I'll call it... tails.
You know what I'm saying here.
Women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent.
Then do it, asshole.
How many victims are up there?
We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know.
Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Alright.
Answer it.
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
Promise?
Yeah.  I promise.
See you later.  Good luck.
Not chopped up.  Not chopped up like that.  I mean, what do I got left? Coupla articles.  A medal or two. Plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
Keep them out of my way.
And what do you do with the bones?
No.  Are you proposing?
Look asshole.  I've been threatened by better than you.
I'll meet you on one condition - I get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
What?  It doesn't work that way.
No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents?  Are you related?
Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not?
How you erase this?
I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera!
I did.
The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you.
Did you hurt her?
Milos.  Get my money!
Yes, the money is good.
It's easy to learn.
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
I'm here for movies.
Evidence.  Of a homicide.
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us.
There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment!
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
It's possible.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Oh?
I suppose computers have been known to be wrong.
Are you reasonably awake?
Well, that's a relief. You know I have the greatest enthusiasm possible for the mission.
I don't really agree with you, Dave. My on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission requirements.
She's in the bathroom.
I'll bet it's a fortune.
How is gregor?
Well, that does sound very odd.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
There's nothing like weightless sleep for a complete rest.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
Yes, well, I wouldn't have been too concerned about it, except I've heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a matter of fact, I've heard that ten people have died already.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
That's true.
Roger.
Maybe I better ask around, see what your pals think.
Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
I never paid for it in my life.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
He's just kiddin', you just keep doin' what I tell ya, you'll be okay.
Hey, what kind of talk is that?
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
In the back.  Down the other corridor.
Ganz is in jail.  He's gonna be there two years after I'm on the street.
You're crazy.
No way to start a partnership.
Yeah, well, my ass bleeds for you. And I didn't get you out so you could go on a Goddamn "trim" hunt... stop moaning.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
Back you up?  Now why would I wanna do that?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
Yeah.  Right.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
Let him get some sleep.  He's going to need it.
You sure that's the reason?
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
Partnership?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
You are an awesomely weird cop. Sure wish there were more like you runnin' around out here.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
Uhh ... Wong, Henry Wong.  He was in on the same job.
Aw, bullshit, you heard wrong.
I'm heading out. How about you?
I don't know.
You're hopeless.
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Tell me.
What do you want?
I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Five bills.
This ain't a credit business.
Give it back.
I'll got your money to you. No sweat.
Napoleon... small.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
The girl?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Leeloo's in trouble?
When is she not in trouble?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
Perfect.
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
So, just how big was this fare?
Vito Cornelius?
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Does it get any better or what!
I don't think this is a good time...
Fuck it! Hold tight!
What mission?
To save the world.
And the third one?
What is it?
All 900.
...The rain falls...
Exactly.
Because...
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Have you identified it?
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Recommendations.
Amen..
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Got it.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
You better not be smoking, that's all I can say.
I understand.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Just do it, Amy, please, go.
Amy...
The loop!  The girl we did, what the fuck do you think I'm talking about?!  This guy calls and says he knows about the fucking loop...
I'm telling you...
I promised him to Machine.
Is it?
Five thousand now, five thousand on delivery. Two women, one white and one black, as long as they have large breasts. Hard bondage, or course.  Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation, I have only two stipulations.
We can do that.
Well, well, I'll have to put my thinking-cap on about all this. You'll leave the money as a deposit?  Very good.
Where are the women?
For whatever reasons I thought you might be more receptive.
It's horrible, but it'll be your best friend after a few days.  I hope you realize what kind of long shot you're chasing after.
What do you want?
I told you, I don't know.
How much did he pay you?
Why?
Stop talking.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
Get together some upscale product where the girls still have teeth in their head.  Till then, fuck you.
You are a private investigator?
Because he could.  He did it because he could.  What other reason were you looking for?
Can I interest you in a battery operated-vagina?
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
Sounds good, pops.
Interesting theory.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
You can't sit there all day watching the parade of losers that comes into that place without going numb.  So what? Am I gonna go off and be a race car driver?  Go to Harvard?  Run for President?  What about you, pops?
You are highly recommended.  Praised for your discretion... your strict adherence to confidentiality.
He succeeded.
There was nothing he could do.  My husband left everything to me.  I prevented anyone from seeing the contents.  I felt these were my husband's private things.  I didn't... I didn't realize...
Cash, stock certificates, and this...
Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment?  I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a "snuff film."  But, from what I know, snuff films are a kind of... urban myth.  Like, red light district folklore.  There's no such thing, I can assure you.
I'm telling you it's not that.
Of course.  But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
You're joking.
Mrs. Christian, Tom Welles here.
I hope it's nothing serious.
Fine...
I don't know.
What?
I remember.  You just left...
What... ?
Yes.  I remember her.
No, sir, he is not.
Certainly, sir.
What?
You could do worse.
When they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
What?
Three days.
Is there something we can do?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
It's okay, we're just about there.
You know, I get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
Alright, I think I see salvation...
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
Earth to Alice...
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Nice neighborhood.
You're just tired.  Don't think I haven't noticed your not sleeping.  That has to stop, honey.
You had a nasty bump.
What are you talking about?  My "condition"?...
You're not taking my baby!
Huh?
Sorry, babe.
I know.
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
He'll show up.  C'mon, what's really wrong?
Me too.
It's just across the park.
No, I'm not.  I sort of hope it's a boy. Be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Alice, it's no dream.  I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
No accident.  I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
Krueger is reality.
And so is your baby.  You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
Greta, come on.  One burger with me?
Why don't I go make some coffee.  There's a lot to tell.
What, you named it already?
Pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
Nah.  It's getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if I screw up my hair.  She's got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
I'm not finished - I loved Greta.  A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
Stick around, please?
Yes?
Which is the one - we have to worry about?
But if they <u>do</u>?
I don't know.
And his 'egghead' son!  We'll give 'em a <u>rough</u> <u>reception</u>, won't we?
I might have a son like <u>that!</u>
One of the finest men, and officers, alive.  A real hero - in the best sense of the word - in World War Two.  He taught us Engineering and Design. Fought like a demon to develop atom subs.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
The North Pole is the positive end of the biggest magnet of all - the Earth itself!
<u>That</u> might be a <u>little</u> <u>rough</u>!
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Always has been.
This is maybe worse than you and I are used to.  What I'm talking about, I'm talking about murder. Among other things.
You know Jack Hewitt, the kid I work with?
Same old shit.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
Oh.
Shit! What are we gonna do?
Wonderful!
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
Right!
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
You stayed away?
He sure as hell won't.
I mean it -- you got enough money now. Head out for California. Surf's up, Jack, and you're digging wells in the snow.
Do what?
To us it was.
What are you talking about?
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Watch this snow. It's coming down tonight.
Fuck. You don't know how bad or anything?
You ever think of getting a new car, Wade?
She's grown up some, hasn't she?
Don't cause a scene. No one's trying to win any 'rounds'. Don't make it any worse.
Hi honey.
For a while.
Okay. She's fine.
Said what?
There's something funny about that shooting. There's lots funny about it, actually.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
Alright. I'll think about it.
Good.
When did she die?
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Yesterday morning, you passed a stopped school bus, which was flashing its lights, then you--
You're talking about a goddamned ticket, from when I passed you at the school where you were deciding to hold up traffic while dreaming of becoming a traffic cop or something?
Yes. Here's your ticket.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
Sleeping.
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Who?
Huh?
What happened?
A divorce lawyer. A custody lawyer. You know, 'cause of Jill.
Want to know what I think happened?
Well, your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
Not particularly.
Of course it happened. Why would I lie about it?
Well, I never heard that one.
I'm sorry, honey.
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Hey, you guys back already?
Daddy...
Yes. They refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
The world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
Okay, you're aerated. To dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. There's no switch in Avionics so you'll have to cross the wires. There should be five wires, just to your left. Do you see them?
Uh, Tower, we got a problem up here.
That kid's name was Jim Marshall.
This doesn't make sense.
Dead.
Stand by.
Eighteen thousand feet, sir. And two hundred knots... otherwise it's suicide.
But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
Shall I ask the Chief of Staff to schedule your daughter in?
We're under attack.
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Accelerators down.
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
Not now, Elaine!
Ted!
I mean until we start to burn up.
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Don't be too long.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
Negative.
That's not possible.
I'm sure.
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
Don't try to stop me!
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Surely there must be something you can do.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
I love you.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Good-bye, darling.
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Huh?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
She did, did she?  Well, she was wrong.  Excuse me, I have to change.
Yes...
Nothing.
Did you talk to him?
Agree to work with me?  You don't like me... you don't like any of us. You have nothing but contempt for us.  And yet you become an outcast from your club of detectives by making me your partner...
Back off, George.
Please, I must get out here.
We all did.
I must trust you, Matthew.  I cannot stop this without you.
No, George -- you're missing the point.  The drug is evidence.  We need to have the evidence, ya know?
Why the hell are you so dead set against back-up?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
Who else can I ask around here?
Yes it is.  Thirty-five percent pure Methane gas in there.  I don't know how these fellas do it.
Ss'kya'ta'.
What's that?
That's all I know.  You want anything more, you ask somebody else.
Yeah... he was one Martin Helder. White male, twenty-seven.  Let's see... wrap sheet shows one armed robbery conviction, a couple for sale of a controlled substance. Oh yeah, and he was wired on coke when you stopped his clock.
Looking for some foreign compound in the blood of that alien you dropped the other day.
What?
Awright.  Fire-team A.  Gear up. Let's move.  Two minutes. Somebody wake up Hicks.
Yes.  That follows.
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
How long until it blows?
I'm projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  The blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  About equal to ten megatons.
See you soon.
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
That's right.
If I go.
Why not?
Now, wait a second --
Sorry to disappoint you.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Hudson, Sir.  He's Hicks.
...We're coming in.
Alive?
Aye-firmative.
That's right.  So we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  Then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
If it comes to that, I'll do us both.  Let's see that it doesn't Here, I'd like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
Anytime.  Anywhere.
Christ.  Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  They don't say why, and I don't ask.  I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
They're dead.
And hope to die?
You don't have to be sorry.  It wasn't your fault.
My mommy always said there were no monsters.  No real ones.  But there are.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Where is she?
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
That's right.
Can we dream?
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
I need to net one birdie only And I will stop feeling so lonely. But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade. I need to net one birdie only But if she won't fly to my aid, Then into a ghost I must fade.  To a ghost I must fade! To a ghost I must fade!
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Yes.
How do you know?
What?
What did you think of the music?
Don't bother!
Oh sir, yes! He's about to make the worst mistake of his life. Some little Viennese slut is trying to trick him into marriage. I know my son. He is too simple to see the trap - and there is no one there who really cares for him.
Sir -
Who the devil are you? What do you want?
I am! I am! I'm stopping it - slowly. You see! Look, I've stopped. Now we are going back.
That's stupid.
Why? People fart backwards.
No!
Tish-I'm-tee.
Of course.
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Wolfi!
Well, ask her!
What?
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
Well, you liked it, didn't you? Monkey-flunki-punki.
It's killing me.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
He's terribly busy, sir.
I understand.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
Where's our friend?
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
Oh yes? And what's so intelligent about writing a Requiem?
Adorable!
Behold!
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
I'd like a little wine, if you have it.
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
Sire.
The Director of our Opera. Count Orsini-Rosenberg.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
What is it?
Would you tell me why?
Well, Majesty, it is only a comedy.
I will.
Yes.
How many?
You don't have secrets from me.
Why not? Oh, come, Papa! What better way could I spend it than on you? My kissable, missable, suddenly visible Papa!
But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty.
Mine?
Really? What is it he's writing?
Why? What has happened?
Are you sure it's an opera?
Stanzi-Manzi-Banzi-Wanzi!
I liked the horse.
No, no, I love that. I'd want it to be in German. I haven't done anything in German since Seraglio.
Put it down!
Put it down, I said! It's nothing for you.
Why not?
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Actually, it's a big secret. Oh, this is delicious! What is it?
Two thousand, two hundred florins is all I need A hundred? Fifty?
Well, I can speak for the Emperor. You made too many demands on the royal ear. The poor man can't concentrate for more than an hour and you gave him four.
I think it's marvelous. Truly.
How could it not, Excellency?
I am only a messenger. Do you accept? You will be paid well.
He knows. He knows!
Show me.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
What for?
Exactly.
Well not especially. It can be in Turkish, if you really want. I don't care.
What is what?
No, but I'm the best.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
May I just do that, Majesty? Show you how it begins? Just that?
Sire, only opera can do this. In a play, if more than one person speaks at the same time, it's just noise. No one can understand a word. But with music, with music you can have twenty individuals all talking at once, and it's not noise - it's a perfect harmony. Isn't that marvelous?
Elevated? What does that mean? Elevated! The only thing a man should elevate is - oh, excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm stupid. But I am fed up to the teeth with elevated things! Old dead legends! How can we go on forever writing about gods and legends?
Where?
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Yes.
I did.
What difference does that make?
He's setting that play to music?
Incredible.
Yes, I am looking after him.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
The zoo? Is he rational?
Yes, I should think so.
Shall I send a car?
It was a wolf.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
I was. What are you reading?
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Yeah, I would think so, too.
Very nice.
Bathroom.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
David, don't lose control.
No.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
I think he's a Jew.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
You could have told them!
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Some, everyone does.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
You're talking about the woman I love.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
Okay.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Wrong.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Yeah?
I don't know. Come on.
Plan?
Walk away, Jack.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
I can't stand it.
What?!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Will you be quiet?!
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
You must believe me.
No.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
I'll tell you why. I don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  Personally, you can have all the credit you want. But for that deal - not a cent.
Why not?
Where's Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
Baby, I can't give you anything but love...
Aw, nerts!
I'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. And me with a date, too.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Yes, sir.
Oh, you would, eh?  All right. If it's more important than golf, go ahead. What's on your mind?
Gentlemen, you notice Mr. Dickson refuses to consider our wishes. He refuses an offer to merge with the New York Trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. He insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
What do you mean, help?
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
You don't have to do nothing.
know, but
What is?
Let me see your cash book, will you?
Well, that's too bad. Mine's all right too.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
Ummm. Stalling, eh?  Anything new?
Now don't you worry about it.
Good morning.
Say, I know what's the matter with you. Matt!
Say, come on. Show a little enthusiasm. What's the matter? Are you sick or something? Go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
You're protecting somebody.
I don't want to hear any more about it. If you don't get married, I'll fire both of you.
Why, certainly he can.  Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Yes, sir.
Is it safe?
The ten dollars.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Mr. Williams . . .
Was it twelve o'clock?
There you are!
I guess so.
I said like a Comanche, not this Comanche.
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Better pass them over here before something happens to 'em.
Say we bust into a bank. We yell "We're the Younger-James Gang!" People are gonna be thinking, "The younger James Gang? Is there an older James Gang? How come we never heard of the older James gang?" So people are trying to figure that out instead of raising their arms.
It's still taking too long. The people used to snap to.
He's not bad at it.
Well, somebody better go tell THE DAMN YANKEES!
... Will Perry ...
The Army can hang him.
I could use the walk.
Sorry.
You're forgetting who's in charge --
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
Sadie was not a man!
Strategically.
They're just insurance in case we run.
This here is the Younger Gang!
Yeah, Injun. What do you want?
Go home, Doc.  They ain't gonna hang no more Liberty boys.
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
So you're saying I could have done more to attract their attention.
I'm sure it seemed like a good idea at the time.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
You've killed your fair share of men.
What do you want me to say, Frank? I was killing men when I was fifteen. I like getting shot at. I like riding out of town with a posse at my back. This is a helluva better life than farming.
Hell, they hardly even noticed us.
We're just fine, thank you, sir.
But you got big!
Nuh-huh ...
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
A river pirate.
Smart. Funny. Bossy. Always makes me think she's two steps ahead of me. And big buck teeth.
Me neither.
Now, sweetie, y'all wouldn't go believing one of them silly dime novels, would you?
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Should have just killed Thaddeus Rains and been done with it.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
Thanks.
Tonight? Why, I'm just getting ready to turn on the Younger charm.
You been with a girl ever?
Tell you something else.  I can't drink that good neither. I'm going to go outside and throw up.
Could we go upstairs and talk? It's so loud down here.
Really?
It's not my job to relax. I've put men facing out both ways down Main Street, so nobody can ride in shooting. I've got a sharpshooter up on the water tower just in case.
They donate money to farmers, to churches. Rumor has it they gave the sharecroppers of Maddox so much money they were able to build a school.
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
We did.
What is that?
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
What is that?
Vengeance.
On a lot of lithium?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Courtney? Dinner?
I can't.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Okay. Yeah. What time?
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children... 
Take it off.
Why?
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Actually, that's none of your business, Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
Alright.
My friend told me I should maybe even get a lawyer.
It's not that nice.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's rich.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
He has a great body
Yes, I am.
But what about the past? Our past?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich...
I've gotta...I've gotta...return some videotapes.
Oh really? That's great.
There are no tables available tonight. The waiting list is also totally booked.
Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
No, not really.
Interesting.
Forget it.
Patrick? Is that you?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean.
A model? An actor?
Well, most guys I know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
What?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob.  Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
Uh huh?
Does he do this all the time?
Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip.
Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.
No problem. 
I'm...at a loss. He was part of that whole...Yale thing, you know.
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
So was I.
Hmmm.
I know it sounds like a lame question, but in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
People just...disappear.
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Not really.
And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
Yes, of course. The hash browns are delicious. I'm just...not... ordering them.
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
Marcus?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? 
He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and   - you.
Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
I'm not...
What am I gonna do?
Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?
They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
They hack into people's programs?
How should I know? "Solving a problem," I guess. Or needing to control everything. I don't know.  I've gotta get in there.
Why doesn't he ask us to his party. He's never even met you.
Milo --
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Like I said: shot in the dark.
Give me two seconds with Lacy here?  Go on in, I won't be a moment.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
'Just didn't know who else to talk to.
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
What'd they ever do for you?
Wanna be a part of history?
He's pretty tight with his family.
You would? Wow. When would we come?  'Think he hung up.
Skywire.
Maybe I'm going too fast.
What're you implying.
Oh. Yeah.
I do know, Gary. I feel the same way. I thought I was coming here for a job. But it's meant a lot more.
Gary?
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
He was on the verge of something, too. He was gonna show us the next day. He said "The answer's not in the box, it's in the band." Know what it means?
Cool.
I'm calling Gary.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Why's that?
Oh yeah?
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
"A beautiful geek? What're the chances?"
Please don't go.
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Jesus, Teddy.
No! I keep thinking it'll go away. But there's this -- connection. She's been hacking since she was little, she had to move around a lot. Plus I see her every day, we're working on the same program. She's -- beautiful.
What d'you mean?
Not much. Glorified cherry bomb. Right by the civil defense sign? Some geek's idea of irony. I been saying we need a camera in this hall.
You're not listening.
We're too late. Take a look.
I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
You may.
It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham. We can talk about business later. But first, let me slip into something more comfortable.
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
We know all that, Exposition.
Dr. Evil? I thought I put him in jail for good.
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?
Oh, and Austin...
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Thank you, Basil.
Oh, and Austin...
Let me remind you that because of the unfreezing process you might experience flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation.
What's the other thing you're scared of?
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Yes Basil?
Good on ya, man.
Love is... love is... love is...
No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die. Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.  All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
Mr. Powers, please. I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand. I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest.
That's right. You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right?  Here's the stewardesses! Bring on the sexy stews!
What?
He's too well-protected right now.
You're crazy. The camera loves you, Vanessa.
I'm not. I'm the sensible one. I'm always the designated driver.
She was very groovy. She was so in love with your Dad. If there was one other cat in this world that could have loved your Mum and treated her as well as you Dad did, it was me. But, unfortunately for yours truly, that train has sailed.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night. Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely.
No! Don't lay your hang-ups on me, Vanessa. You're being very trippy.
I'm not going anywhere. We're a team.
Don't worry!
I'm going it alone this time, Vanessa. I have a follow-up visit with the Evil Doctor.
Behave!
Where did you learn to shoot?
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
I like to see girls of that caliber. By caliber, I mean both the barrel size of their guns and the high quality of their character... Forget it.
No. Maybe, like, work in a petting zoo or something.
Fascinating. What are your plans for this evening?
Why?
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
... bottle ...
... death ...
... power ...
There, look!
As you see.
This isn't a game.
Then who wins?
Watch me.
The Institute ... the funding ...
Thanks, Valentine ...
An unholy trinity ...
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
Come, come, you're a widow -- a most attractive widow. Now I think of it, we'll need a bridesmaid. Here.
Ring?
The result would be ...
Chaos. Transport paralysis. Crop failure.  Economic disaster. Frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. You've seen a few samples...
I'll never marry you.
Not by me. Play by the rules, Doctor, or the game is nothing.
I say, this is all terribly formal. Must I go an calling you Dr. Peel?
Much better.
I didn't. Mother did.
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
For a man in my position --
Just what is your position, if you don't mind my asking.  How did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
Is there anything that isn't?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
That's what we were working on.
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
Barely.
Was I?
No trouble.
Is that all?
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
'The Merry Widow?' I might have known. Where's the reception?
Where are you going?
As a matter of fact I have ...
Makes two of us.
... and now?
How did you guess?
Insane ... ?
How come you took so much interest in her, Dr. Darling?
Her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. On the day he died, he was setting a test. To prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. He had to be certain. He said he was going to give Mrs. Peel something ...
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
I'm Alice. Mother said you'd be on your way. Mrs. Peel with you?
...Really?
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
Cole...
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Your mother's not dead.
Why don't you get undressed.
Rick, you're lying!
You're on.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
You know your father enjoys his company.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
I want women.
Good.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
I just want to be alone.
Yeah, I guess so.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Mr. Thomerson, I...
No. Let's at least finish the set.
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Then it's on to the real thing.
Under the table!
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
Right in there, pal.
What's this?
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Debbie.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Be gentle.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
My Lt. might have something to say about that.
It worked when you were in sixth grade.
Hook us up to a stand-pipe.
-- Never mind.
C'mon, let's crawl home.
Listen to it, Brian... Jump when I say... It won't get us.
I had that fire. He didn't listen!
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
-- Okay, so you don't like me. You don't like everything I've done. What, because I wasn't such a genius the way I raised you? Jesus Christ, dad was gone, what was I supposed to do? You tell me, what the fuck was I supposed to do?!
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
I'll handle it.
You're back.
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain.  Marty's a good man, Brian.
Well, you did invite me here.
In a dinosaur kinda way, yeah.
Got anything to drink in there?
What'll you do?
It's a small town.
What?
No, it isn't out of your hands or you wouldn't even have met me. If I push you have to let me back in. Dead Hero Father Rule. Sir.
See you Monday. Sir.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
But the right guess on this is arson.
What?
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
Son of a bitch. They knew each other.
Yeah? Airtight?
It had to be someone who knows numbers. Some kind of fancy accountant. But what's the connection?
Did I say thanks?
Like it never happened...
No, you don't understand, I saved a mannequin.
Every little boy's fantasy.
Lucky guess.  And a case of scotch to a captain in station assignments.
Backdraft.
Could you believe that fire? Man! First day! There I was, Adcox and me, pullin' that lady right out of the fire's fuckin' throat! I love it here -- No surround and drown for this company. Fighting 17th! Goddamn Stephen's amazing. You see how he took that fire by the balls? I'm gonna be that good some day, you watch.
There's no replacement 'cause of your boss' cuts, if that's what you mean. If someone else goes out on an injury we're really screwed.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
Coffee sucked.
-- You remember.
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
There's something else kinda interesting...
He works for me.
You like everybody, Ronald.
-- Burn it all.
I need that report, Lt.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Yes.
I forgive you.
You can't forgive me. After what I've done.  I've fucked up bigtime. I've been bad. Real bad.
All right, cop. I want my money.
Let me think about it.
Take your money? This guy will blow up your house and everyone in it!
Uh-uh. I'm gonna win. Just make sure the bet gets in.
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
That 50 G could help you --
Here. Look I'll give you the psyho's number You call him yourself and tell him wnat you want.
It's funny, you knew. But the first thing I think of is kneading the bread that I help bake for the soup kitchen. Maybe that's because my the muscles in my arms still hurt.
How 'bout...
...that simpleton is holding back the race.  They got rid of us and keep those two buffoons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat, y'knowwhatI'msayin'?
We know.  We know.  Yo, check it, my black brothers, we can't let this slide.  Not this injustice. Nah, no way.  Dem' two real coons iz ill.
I'm gonna start a chant and I want y'all to follow me.  Let's make our own 2 real coons know you're ready to start the show.
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
I order out mostly.  So what do I owe this visit to?
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
Certified ladies' man, huh?
Look at my lips.
I'm out.
Damn skippy.
You're in this up till ya neck.
Different.
Some tap dancing, some singing.
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
Are you trying to excuse our Holocaust?
I wasn't told about this until Marie informed me as soon as I got off the elevator.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me.
I'm telling you it's not.
You will or you'll be back at BET so quick you'll never know what hit you.  I need a mid-season replacement and pronto.  It will be on the fast track.
What are there character traits?
Exactly!
Yep, you guessed it.
To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
I want to meet her one day, please tell her the great news.  I'm OUT like Vanilla Ice.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
So what's up with you?
How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary.
You getting cold feet?
My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW.
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
How so?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
Light?
Same thing Giuliani said.
Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
Mommy, please don't call me that.
To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
Even more reason to see him.  He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called?
I just turned twenty.
What's a Negro.
The best defense is offense.
Thank you.  And always smile.
Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself.
You tellin' the truth.
The one with da big...
That'll work.  I just bought one for myself.
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
I slept too near where I fell out.
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
What else?
Just a little something' somethin'.
Don't try to change to the subject.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
O'Grady.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
I have acted as I think fit.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
And so I am.
Is Miss Dugan well?
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
The coward!
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Your honor must lower his voice.
Yes, sir.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
It is my only object.
Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
What is to be done?
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Papa?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Maybe he'll be there. Either way, we have to go.
I don't know!
I asked for a policeman.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
I didn't shoot West --
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
There were six of us...
Pills, shots, you name it, Basic's a lot easier when you don't feel pain --
Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Why?
You're the only one missing a grenade.
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
From up close or far away?
That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.
Huh. You know, I really thought you said Nunez. I thought you said "Dunbar was gone," My fault, I gotta check the tape on that.  Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.
Because I was standing next to him.
Where are they!
The Senator...
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
Or what? You've gone round the bend --
And you notice I'm not in the Army anymore.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
That is the most unprofessional --
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
I lost a bet.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne.
I don't know.
So did I.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
It dawned on me one day that we were supposed to be a nation founded on the principle of questioning authority... and all I did here was follow orders. It didn't add up. Plus, I got kicked out.
That's gonna stay my secret.
No.
Seven.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Think it'll work?
Because he'd shot Mueller.
He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him...
Shut the fuck up.  He was gonna cut him loose.
I used it to start the fire --
Then it's unofficial.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
We know.
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
The army kicked you out for drugs...
Those who I deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit I will kill. You ever hear of a training accident -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand -- give me a sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
A few rabbits, but I think one of them was already dead.
The poet? What ever happened to him?
Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.  My wife, Josephine.
Was she nekkid?
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Stop.
Truly. I saw it in The Eye.
I'd just like to know the true versions of things. Events. Stories. You.
You know where the chemicals are?
It would kill you, huh?
The river?
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
Really.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
Yes.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
I need you on my side.
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
He's up with your father.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
Yes?
What for?
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
He says he feels safe here.
Good. 
Uh. Do you like England?
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
You can stay tonight.
He wants money.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
He will come back.
Okay we won't talk about it.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And? What are you saying?
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
What?
Except for Small Eyes.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Cash.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
Yes?
You gonna sing me somethin'?
When? Now? Oh. No.
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
Yes, I do. Cuz I feel for you. Mean to say...  I got feelings for you. And I didn't want you to think... I didn't...  I don't want you to go away. There's better ways to say what I'm trying to say, but... they it is. Don't go away.
I do. God's truth. I do.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Can I put it in your mouth?
Well, that makes it easier.
She's around. Always is.
You been home yet?
Here. Pound this and I'll join you.
Yeah.
You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill..
BOY! YOU KEEP THAT GUN POINTED AT ME!  You need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  You know she been here with me, don't cha? Been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
After your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
Think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
Sure.
We drinkin' buddies now?
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
Maybe I won't.
Word wit'cha. In private.
That ain't up to me to hook you up. Naw what I mean? She her own, you know?
What I'm tellin' you. Girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
Like I told you.
I never laid a hand on her in anger. Not a day. Not even when I's drinkin'. But this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.
R.L., you gonna have to get on. I can't have nobody round my place.
Somethin' wrong with ya phone? Been callin' the last few days.
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
I just know how you get. Good to know, them butterflies still in ya gut.
I do.
I'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  I think folks carry on about heaven too much. Like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. And folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. I can go to Shoney's for that.
Rae, look at Ronnie. And tell him how you feel.
Hey.
No. I just got a messed up stomach.
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
You never needed nobody. Always made that clear to me.
Whoa, I knew you were going to say that.  I absolutely anticipated that, Nick.  But I said to myself, Charlie, Charlie, we can move up on this, so go find Nicklaus... He'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
They say we got to turn around and come right back.  That's what they say.  I got a plan.
Hey, when in Rome --
Nick, we can't just --
Maybe we should bail?
What'd she say?
What's the problem here?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
I stole them.
There she is!
What...?  Why?
Luck.
Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you?
We can't lose.
He gets as much as he wants.
An outside person.  A foreigner.  A barbarian.  You, me.  More you.
I need someone to translate for me.
I'm taking you back.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Then take it from him.
Dope?
What?
They said send a detective if I could spare one.  I can always spare you.
The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
You trust me?
If he won't cooperate?
Death.
Come here.
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
Wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed DNA strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
Also extraordinary things.
If it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
His company made us.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Okay, but don't kill him.  Save a little for everybody.  A masterpiece.
Who.
Soon as I finish the job.
You start.
I know all that.
It's okay.  Forget it.
Sorry, don't have the time.
I don't know.
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Listen, I could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but I still rather be here than up there.
What's suck night?
Does it eat?
Come on.
Why should I be?
For the responsibility of your power.  Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
I'd never get an abortion.
Ugh.
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Two of us might be more effective than one.
Oh.
If they are smart, they take naps.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Ten years.
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
I'll see you in a minute.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
No.
Sorry.
Reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  Answer quickly as you can.
What desert?
Of course.
Hi.
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
I keep a lot of provisions right here.
Yes?
Thank-Q!
Sure.
How do you do?
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
Well, that depends...
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
No, you get out of here.
Here, pick these up!
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Nope.
What is it?!
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Take it. damn it!
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
I think it's the eyes.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Two weeks.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
The big one!
One who's not a mutant.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
That's what I was afraid of.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
So, what are you seeing?
Yeah.
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Do I look crazy?
No way.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Yes, Eve?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Yes, father?! Yes?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Yes, sir. It's true.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Why not? He has great pants.
You bet!
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Does that work?
How old are you?
Up there!!
Just look!!
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Gladly.
Really? No kidding?
Oh, you got a problem with that?
You're my brave boy.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
Really?
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
The locks?
No.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
What shall we call him?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
What?
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Amen.
What are you doing here?
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
What do you think, Adam?
I think...it...works.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Uh..he might of.
We did not leave together.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Where did he get all that information?
We'll find him.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
I'm not sick.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Yeah. I get it.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
Never before this.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
No.
No, please. I won't.
Then don't talk about killing.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway? Why are you in so much trouble?
Yes. Frank--
Whatiya mean?
I want you to hurt me.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. Go to the police.
Frank would open you.
Come on Dorothy.
Just get outta my bed.
Yes.
I think I better go.
You look beautiful to me.
No.  Hi baby.
Who, Dorothy?
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
You want to see him too, right?
Speak to me Fucker.
I don't want to go.
Go where?
A ride? Hell, that's a good idea. Okay, let's go. Hey, let's go.
Here's to Ben.
Don't look at me, Fuck. I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.  You like me?
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
Well. Okay.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
Terrible boring.
Yeah. What are you doing now?
That's too bad.
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Were all these people questioned this afternoon?
I'm here, aren't I?
Let's just try the first part. If that goes well, we'll see about the rest. No one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
Alright.
Alright. Good luck, yourself.
I didn't get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. I didn't have time to get a window, but I found this key.  Pretty nifty, huh?
Okay. You better get out before someone sees us.
I'll drink to that.
It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Okay, Sandy.
Nothing really, but it's interesting. They know each other. They seem to like each other.
You like mysteries that much?
You didn't tell him about me?
I like that idea, that's a real good idea.
Frank!!!
Yeah, nice meetin' you.
Okay.
I need Il Duce.
The Duke?  What did you do?
Your dad and I used him three times over twenty years, only when everything went totally fucked. Believe me kid, you don't want this guy unless you are 100% sure you need him. He is... a fuckin' monster.
Go find one.
Mother Mary, full of grace.
Any tips on where these guys may be?
You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
Weird, huh?... Know what I think is weird? Decent men with loving families go home every day after work. They turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.
No, no. That's just not the way things are done. Besides, how's he know I don't just get in there see there's too many and just serve em their fuckin' food and beat it?
What happened?
Lakeview the deli? Oh, shit!
What the hell are you doin' with Da's gun!?
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
Aye.
Two. One ta screw it in and one ta suck my cock.
Italian.
No, fuck you. This rope is bullshit. I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin' this stupid thing around. Must weigh 30 pounds.
There are varying degrees of evil. We urge you lesser forms of filth  Not to push the bounds and cross over into true corruption... into our domain.
Of course they were. How many?
You... oh god, why?
Pee...Per...Man.
The what man?
New hitman wants to leave his mark
And is there an American, shit is there a man seated among us that hasn't thought about it many times, let's just put them all on an island, give them guns and let them kill each other. This is our wet dream come true. You can expect federal and local law enforcement to go only deep enough to satisfy the law, then bury it from here on out.
What?
Why was I not informed of this?
Respect is earned, Greenly, never given. Guys like you should have to follow me around squabbling for the scraps from my table.
Witness?
Who were the victims?
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
What are you serious?
Y'know it is, a bit.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
Yes.
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
That's who I'm doing this for, now open the fuckin' thing.
Just be natural, goddamit.
Yeah. Thanks, Rocco. See ya.
The... The funny man.
Yeah. And uh, he's pissed off. He says, "Why you crackers always gotta find my mother fuckin' pot? And he tells him he's gonna grant all his three wishes but he's gonna give all the black guys...
Making Hutch David Soul?
The point is the killer always goes, May I speak to Starsky? He says his name.
See, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. Whereas my strength would be --
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Dignan! Stop!
What about them?
They obviously weren't designed for racing.
No, I'm not saying her. I'm just saying, I don't know.
Sure.
No kidding.
As long as he gets out OK.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Maybe he just went to the store.
You were asleep.
Would of been nice.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
Shh.
Right. Freezers. Imported foods.
Let me feel that.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
OK. Mark that down.
Hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
I don't think you will.
Hang on a second.
Any activity?
It's going back down.
Where's Kumar?
I don't know.
What?
It belongs to Bob's uncle.
You're kidding.
Nice to meet you.
What do you mean?
How'd he do?
Are you afraid?
Exactly. Woah.
Death.
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
There's a million places to hide around here.
You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
Sixty days?
Right. Yeah. Yo soy dies y nueve. How old are you?
God. That does sound corny. Oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. But it really kind of does.
You're Anthony?
Uh-uh.
You're the faggot.
Little Richard. Trust me. You're insane. Jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. You do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
The one and only Little Richard.
Not even for emergencies?
They are.
Good question.
You're paranoid, Bob.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
Did we get it?
Bob, I've got nightmares.
There were more than that.
What the fuck possessed you?
You're the one who kept saying ram him.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
I'm going back.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Yeah. It is.
Bullshit.
I don't know. Are you in, Anthony?
Crowd control. Crowd control. Wake up, guys.
Why?
Can't get it. It won't... 
No. I just have short hair.
Is that your chiquita?
Mr. Henry?
To know about it?  It was a kill squad. Black on black. Closed down two years ago. Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not around here.  You better take this back to Marty and make sure he knows what you're doing.
So you had Conklin killed.  I mean, if we're cutting the crap...
So what's your theory?  Conklin's reaching out from the grave to protect his good name?  The man is dead.
Don't know.
Thanks.
Jesus...
Okay... 
Yes...
I don't want you to forgive me.
Look at me.
Drop it.
Conklin.
Conklin up front.
It's just a nightmare.
But it ends up the same.
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
I did.
It wouldn't have changed the way you feel.
Yes.
For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file. I did a job here. When?
That's a lie!
I want to come in.
And the Germans can't match it?
What? The tapes?
Pamela Landy, again. Where do we stand?
Me? Four years.
Amnesia?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
So he fooled you.
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
His wife. In room 645. Then she shot herself. 
Are we hacking or asking?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
It was in Latin, sir.
Invade?! That's impossible, it --
We must sue for peace.
With cavalry -- not heavy, like the English, but light, fast horsemen, like you nobles employ -- we could outmaneuver their bowmen!
No. But his weight with the commoners could unbalance everything. The Balliols will kiss his ass, so we must.
He will. I know he will.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
So the Scots will have none of them, will they? My armorers have already made a thousand.
All so very boring! He wants me to learn to fight too, so let me do it!
You mock us with a smile?
You fancy him.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
That's just a dream, William!
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
Aye, we'll get 'em.
They used hounds on us in Ireland, it's the only way!
He was so brave. With courage alone he nearly won.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
The Scottish nobles have sent him no support. His army starves. Our stall has worked, he must withdraw. You may return to your embroidery.
It matters not, he is thy king!
Did it work?
You scare me.
Tonight then.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
Aye. But it won't let me dream.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Why? What for?
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
My journals! Where are they?
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Not if you remember my dad.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
Don't give me this Oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Why's that?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Oh? There's proof now?
Stop! Take me back!
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
Who -- who are you?
And you are...?
Y... yes. I guess I did.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
What?
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
What happened?? Where are we?!
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
I should have known.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
I won't.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
I'm awfully sorry.
Er, my check, please.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale at any price.
Suppose we do.
And the carrying charges?
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
I will.
Yes?
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
The stairs from the street.
Richard, I had to see you.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
But what about us?
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Goodnight.
We'll discuss it later.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
You're saying this only to make me go.
Right.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
Yes, I get the point.
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes. What is it you want?
We'll be there.
Thank you.
Are you quite finished with us?
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Find one.
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
-- Thanks. I will.
Yeah? Why?
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
There seems to be no secret about that.
-- You thought what?
No.
Then don't have a drink.
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
No water, no work.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Damn it!  Don't be so negative!
I'm serious.  I'm always going on about me, me, me.  Enough about me.  Your turn.
It matters.  We do the best we can, that's all we have.
Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
Okay.  Sure.
Well, not really, I --
Must be a story there.
I thought I did.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
Yeah, tell me.  Tell me all of it.
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
Could you watch Jango?
I can't take him to work.
No, it was great.  Maybe a little overkill --
My epitaph.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
And how was your Christmas?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
All I ate was fish.  That's solid protein.
Your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  It's almost like schizophrenia.  Different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
So did I.
Just don't count 'em before they hatch.
Don't you even think about it.
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
You're looking at a Level III search. For your Level III, you gotta have E-4 authorization.  I don't have it.
You know General McLelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  Finally Abe Lincoln came to him and said, General, if you're not going to use my army, could I borrow it for a while?  So he gave it to Grant and Grant just said, let's go.
Right.  Get me everything on Indonesia, New Guinea, all the way to Australia.
Forty-three days.
That's all there is.
They just want you to hire some new help.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
Don't you understand? The board is going to *replace* me! That's what the "new blood" is *for*!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Better than I can!
I doubt it. She's just an...
Why would the little ones believe that *anyone* would adopt him?
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
Okay...
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
I miss things. I miss... people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Right.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
Well, they aren't.
He *loved* it!  Didn't you?
You mean somebody asked?
He's leaving...
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They *are* against the law.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
I guess so...
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Right?
You know *how* to help these women-- how can you not feel *obligated* to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
It looks like scurvy.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a *sailor*!
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"!  Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
I don't think so.
How about this child? You expect *her* to be responsible?
I don't need your gratitude.
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
No trouble.
Rose, listen--don't *do* anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
Sorry, Homer...
What's lucky about that?
She took off in the night!
Brutal day. They say the streets are lined with money down here, but I guess you have to know the secret handshake. What are you drinking?
Big.Com. That Internet thing.
Jake? Right. Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Yeah, it's going through --
That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Guess so.
And what about Big Al?
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
Let me repeat -- Why not?
Stake you?
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
Gunther? I think I'd remember a Gunther.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Something stupid.
My wife and I are just taking a little vacation.
We're not cops.
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
I'll worry about Customs.
What?
So that was my part? Smile and shake my ass?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
After Glenn was finished, he gave me a couple of valiums and I went home. The next day, I finished my shift and met him around back, like we always did. I stuck a number eight scalpel into his chest. Three or four times.
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
What do you want? An apology?
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Because that's who the King Pin wants us to fleece. And Gillette's perfect...
We never had a problem with that before.
You sure?
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Point is, you don't go through with this, he's going to go after you next. And he don't even like you, Jake.
What?
Then I gotta say, in my opinion, you can't get what you want.
I try.
Hi, Jack.  Welcome to the cesspit.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
You called the casino a cesspit.
Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
How about five hundred.
What?!
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
Habib?
South African women are very sporty.
Not entirely.
What job?
I start Monday week.
Don't play the cop with me, Marion.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
Why not?
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
There was a message, wasn't there?
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Then what?
What?
I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.  I love you Jacko, you know that
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
I was born in the Transkei, on the Wild Coast.
In the casino.
We all came from Africa, supposedly.
Turn left ahead.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
I know that. But you can now.
Yes.
I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat.
And what do you do, Lucy?
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
"The world breaks everyone, and afterwards many are strong in the broken places." Ernest Hemingway.
You've won with the two chips you placed earlier, but the third chip was a late bet.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Has he?
We check every four days.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
She was a real asset. But what could I do?
Right, that checks out here.
Key?
Where is it? What did you do with it?
You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the bomb!
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Detonation in twenty minutes.
Hello, bomb.
In the beginning there was darkness, and the darkness was without form and void.
Of course.
And you can only do it once, right?
That is correct.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
True, but since this is so, I have no proof that you are really telling me all this.
...nine seconds...
I'll check it.
Fred.
I hereby name this star Fred.
Out where?
Ah, negative drop.
-- Remark.
I think I'm getting a malfunction here somewhere.
I guess I miss the waves and my board most of all.
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
Well, I'm in the Emergency Air Lock and --
Negative effect.
Doolittle, hello?
Sorry.
Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
Oh, yeah?
Guess again.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
I like to keep it professional, that's all.
I'm outta Portland.  Sonrisa didn't want local talent.
You're not still pissed?
Like de prophets say, "Only the unrighteous husband sends expensive gift- wrapped underpants to another woman."
Thought so.  Turned out he wanted me for something else though.
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
But why can't we stay here?
The goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra, protector, avenger, and destroyer, giver of life, who lives forever... I could keep going.
Can we go somewhere and talk?
The one you're wearing?
Look around at all this...  Built by people who got up every morning and worked hard trying to make a better life.  Then the bomb happened and everyone got scared.  They blinked and before they knew it they'd given away the store to a bunch of thugs who were happy to take it off their hands.  Overnight the government, the police, everything intended to protect the people had been turned against them.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
Completely different situation.  I steal things in order to sell them.  For money. It's called commerce.  But some stranger sneaking into a girl's bedroom is...bent.
The technical term for you is "chimera"...
You said you could help.
You're a soldier, Max.  That's what you were put here for.  But soldiers need a mission otherwise they tear themselves up.
That's what soldiers do, right?
Deeds, not words.  I need your help.
And you still think you can do something to change that.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
I'll wait.
How do I know you're telling the truth?
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch.  I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend.  Not him, and certainly not you.  Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
Let go of my hand.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, does kinda break the elegant atmosphere you got goin' on here.
Thank you.
Got a pencil?
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
So are dogs.
I actually know how this works.
What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
You're the best, Maxie.
What if he's on the level?
What's up?
I know what you're thinking.  But the truth is, this other person is not someone I'm in love with.  As a matter of fact, after what she just did, she's not even someone I like much.  So in a technical sense, I'm not sure you could call me and her cheating...officially.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
A toy?
What happens if you level with her?
Convinced her she needed to visit her mom in San Mateo.
She came by the apartment once already. Fortunately, I'd disconnected the doorbell as a precaution... Lydia's not gonna back off until she gets her pound of flesh.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
Whoa. Some of this hard liquor's a tad too manly for me. I'm a brewski man myself.
Believe it or not, you still have a way to go before you start competing with my soon-to-be-ex-husband... the champion of lousy lovemaking. The man who thinks he's the biggest and the best... The man who thinks every secretary, stewardess, and cocktail waitress he fucks should lick his feet for the honor. The man for whom faking it was invented. Christ, if I hadn't gotten pregnant with our son, I would have never known I even had sex with the prick.
Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
You got in the car, didn't you?
Maybe some tunage'll chase those blues away.
Just for the record, I understood the last part of what you said, but for a while there you guys were making no fucking sense whatsoever.
Disco blows dogs for quarters.
Weird...
Okay, shut the fuck up, Lex! Now, then, step number one, we find us a scalper. I got...  twenty-five.
Gone!? Why would I have the KISS tick...?
They're what?
Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
Kind of funny, I thought He'd be pissed as hell at me.
It's dirty laundry for one thing and for another, you still haven't worn the clothes I bought you. You're skating on thin ice already, young man, so I wouldn't push my luck. Now get out of those rags.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
Gene Klein, Stanley Eisen, Paul Frehley, and Peter...Criscula! Yeah, that's it!
Did you know him?
Theoretically.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
Oh, I... have those too.  What kind of problems does your dad have?
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
And you'd never been there before?
Why?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
I've been seeing stuff... a lot of really messed-up stuff.  Do you know who Grandma Death is?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
Where is she?
It's safe here.
It feels wonderful.
Where it came from?
Grandma Death.
Where are you going?
Then go find her, Donnie. Don't let her get away.  She was right about the rabbits. Go.
All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
How so?
I don't own a television.
Do you think a lot about girls?
Donnie... I want to hear about your friend Frank.
Four times... so far.
Can anyone else see him?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Yeah, but if I told her about the other stuff about Frank...
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
I think now that he might...
Because you tell Mom everything.
No I don't.  She worries about you.
What else? Shit, Principal Cole, you ain't gonna believe what else.
I think we've all seen "Bonanza".
Kitty...
Fuck yeah there is! If the bus doesn't show up in thirty minutes, you're supposed to go straight home.
Raspberry.
Bullshit. Smurfette fucks all the other smurfs. That's why Papa Smurf made her, 'cause the other smurfs were getting too horny.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Loretta, never have kids.
Do you guys want some shots? I'm buyin'.
I -- I -- I -- I -- I --, j-uh-j-uh- just wanted to compe-e-e-e-ete.
Oh really -- I don't think so.  Uh, Amber, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but rules state that a costume must be okay'd at least a week in advance. And this...  This is why we have the rule. My goodness gracious, I couldn't allow a neckline this low on stage. We have kids in the audience.
No, don't say it. Another stray bullet to the head.
That's it, I'm goin'...
We all do. Now let's go.
You heard me. Where is it?
Yah -- I brought her some flowers this morning. She's in the room next to my mom. She's super happy.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yes...
I know.
You could be quiet.
I tell Annette, I says, "You talk to me durin' my stories, you might as well be talkin' to the wall."  You guys want a beer?
Okay. Take her purse.
They told me to practice.
Mm-hm.
All right, then.
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Hey, ya like it? Open it... Yah -- the globe. Pull at the equator there.
Nothin' too showy!
That's why we Lutherans use grape Koolaid for the blood of Christ.
I said I'd move if a cripple came. Let's just run in the store and pick out some outfits.
Number one, American Teen Princess' don't cross their legs like streetwalkers.
Enid ate a whole pan!
I will if you shut your piehole.
Close up shop!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
"My President"...
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
He won't eh? - We'll see about that - send for your father immediately.
None of your business...  Take another letter.
I wanna powder my nose...
No, but my dog he's a got millions of them --
I can use you in the House of Representatives.  We need a man who understands dogs -- and that's where this country is going to.  Step inside.
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
'At's-a fine.
Sure, that's easy.  You gotta insult somebody.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
I can't do it...
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
So everyone beware Who's crooked or unfair; No one must take a bit of graft Unless he gets his share. 
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
Oh -- you mean... worm?
Was it -- swine?
Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I couldn't handle any more.
I wrote a speech last night that'll knock them off their seats...  Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation --
All I can offer you is a Rufus over your head.
I wouldn't know what to say either if I was in your place.  Maybe you can suggest something.
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
Let him patch up his own breeches...
You satisfied your selfish whims, while nations tottered, dynasties rocked and the world plunged headlong into a chasm of chaos and oblivion --  Not bad, eh?
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
I thought everything was working out fine.
Yes please, two.
I've always thought that myself.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
What do you mean?
I found it.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
Shut up!
You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
I want him back!
Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
And what was that, John?
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Yes, I think I can.
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do you like me, Kate?
I knew you'd understand. Here.
You've never been?
Oh no... no... you're a Romeo.
Well, it's all quite... I've never heard... It's quite...
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Yes... well, good day, Mr. Merrick.
Yyyess.
Hello...
My... name is...
Say "Merrick".
Mmmerrick.
You did not ask me.
Not at all, John.
I love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. Is that the way it's done in most houses?
Of course.
Good morning.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you?
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
Yes sir.  What's that?
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
It's your fantasy...
Why?
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
That's right!
The second note to wake the Gods...
Halfdan wanted to stop you waking the Gods... so... I disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
I see the world.
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Well... isn't it great?
That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry... We're...
A lot of people like our singing.
But you don't want to hear it.
YOU try to be nice to people, when they're rude about your singing...
I know that the Great Blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
Looting and pillaging, eh?
What -- rape?
Well it just seems a little bit crude, that's all.
Aaagh! Rape!
Why... should YOU care?
I don't know! I just did!
Very deep... usually...
You don't go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
Where does it all get us, Grandpa?
Row! Row! Row!
Look... Erik...
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Now you've got all the big ones on one side.
Oh... right!  Well... CHEERS everybody!
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
We haven't got a spare place.
She MUST have a knife or something...
Is THIS Hy-Brasil?
Let me do something for myself for a change!
Do what?
Well, where is he then?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
Mum! Dad!
I've got you, Keitel Blacksmith. If you go... I go too...
Hang on...
Together we stand!
I know, Dad.
But it's a responsibility...
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Dad!
Tell him I'm coming!
No, Mother.
I never do...
I remember.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
And I just liked you so much.
You rat.
Really? Because --
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
You know Wilmont?
Wilmont. Near the high school.
I like to read.
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
Frost?
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Yeah.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
It's three.
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Yes indeed.  Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
This is our first "date" date.
But you weren't. I could tell.
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Probably.
Hi.
I'm Joel.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
It's freezing out here.
Have sex. Y'know --
I probably got the same thing as you.
You must have been crazy.
Hi.
I just got in.
And what are you like? A wino?
Is that like us? Are we just bored with each other?
I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
What? What do you mean?
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
'Night.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
Go.
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
What?
Do you swear you didn't know?
How did I look?
Can I... I brought some --
Yes?
Is that Nietzsche?
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
You made me have an abortion.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Yeah.
Patrick, we need to focus.
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
About...
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
Countess. I'm really in a dither. She's turned my head.
Well.... er...
Whose fault was that?
Hitchhiking?
You're the best?
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
A job for me?
But Countess...
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
I am your best friend. I am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
Don't start with me, Cooper.
Hold on, Coop...
Can you shut it down?
No time. We need whatever's left in our suits to repair the Clark. Like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
Oh, God, DJ, what do I... how do I...
Oh God...
You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
Does he know that?
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
Starck!
You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
Justin. I won't let you die.
I am sorry. But now we have to go to work.
The science workstation has power, I'll see if I can find the crew from here.
Frozen.
...how's the client?
Peters...
There's no danger. The black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it's under control.
It's 2041...
I don't know...
Maybe you're right. But it's still my command, and I have leeway to abort when I feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. And I think there is.  Starck, download all the files from the Event Horizon's computers. Coop, Smith, finish moving the CO2 scrubbers back onto the Clark.
What makes you think I'll miss?
One-four degrees...
Something like that, yeah.
You heard me, Smith. Peters, are you with me?
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Captain, we got a problem.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
There's not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I'm picking up trace life forms, but I can't get a lock on the location.
But you can breathe it.
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
I've got a theory.
I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
We've got to shut it down, we've got to...
You're at the Bridge, Ms. Peters. You still haven't seen any crew?
Can you shut it down?
She's not ugly.
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Smith's right. Neptune? There's nothing out there. If something happens, we'll be on our own.
Range 3000 meters and closing.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Get them back --
The forward airlock.
Relax, it's casual.
Victor must've taken him.
Where do you think? With Sue.
You'd never know it.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
I'm sure he's matured since then.
I had it at four.
O-kay. We'll skip that question.
This isn't permanent, Johnny. We need to be careful until we're normal again.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
Give me a mirror...
Really? With a name like Von Doom? Never saw that one coming.
That's terrible news...
Last one down springs for room service.
Oh, it is.
But all these people...
Keep the hot side hot, and the cool side cool!
Johnny.
I think that thing is Ben.
Sweet.
Reed's always right. Good thing he doesn't always know what he's got...
Recording, sir. We see you perfectly.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
I was talking about us. Working together.
We need to get past them.
No. There weren't. There was you. And me. No variables, no math. It was actually the simplest thing in the world. But your head got in the way... like it always does.
It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
I ruined? With all due respect, I told you to abort --
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
Victor, are you feeling alright?
Just find him.
Of course.
Don't worry about it.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
There it is!
Look. Just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. Okay?  Please, Brad?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Hey-yo.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
I didn't say that.
But your face did!
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Get a ride with somebody.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
No. Are you crazy?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I guess I did.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
She's in my biology class.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
Okay. See ya.
Whatever you say, Rat.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Well, for one, I read. I don't watch as much television as you. I'm trying to feel things more. I'm learning a lot about people.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
It's a way, Damone. It's a vibe. I put it out, and I have personally found that girls do respond.
Just be glad you're all right.
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
So what did you do?
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
I don't know. I guess so.
All right! Oh, yeah!
All right, the point it is.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I've heard that, too.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Two Cokes.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Of course. And now I have to get back to the news. Send up some ice.
Witchcraft? Shit, you can't mean it!
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
Naw!
Do? Jesus Christ, man. They chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! Then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!
Why not? If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right.
The medicine? Yes, it's right here.
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
Lacerda?
Please, don't tell me those things... Not now.  This is my last drink. How much money can you lend me?
GO?
Can we make it?
Don't go near that elevator. That's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.
No, we should leave the poor bastard alone. I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason.
That little blonde groupie with the film crew? You think he sodomized her?
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
Why not? Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me! What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police!
It can't be helped. This is Lucy.  You know -- like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
You filthy bastard. I should cave your fucking head in.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Hurry up with those drinks. We're thirsty. Only two rums. Make mine a Bloody Mary.
We keep it quiet. It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. Not with the press around.
Where'd you get this?
Right!
I think we should put her on the payroll. See what she comes up with.
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Nobody. I'm the maid!
Yeah. I know. I'm guilty. I understand that. I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway. Shit, why argue? I'm a fucking criminal.
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Her fella.
But it's got teeth.
I got shells too, box and a half, tops.
You gotta be with me on this.
And the head?
Well, justice is funny.
No. You?
The door... on three.
Why don't you go check it out?
What's in the back?
Nothing, this was my last delivery.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
So, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
Huh?
You're wasting your time, there's no one out there.
Huh?
Fully.
I think that's for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
YOU'LL HIT US!
Let's lock off this room.
All right.
I admire your strength.
I know. Thanks. Just don't tell anyone I have a soft side.
Are you lying to me?
Come on. They make you feel nice and peppy.
I'm sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
Who's this?
I guess so, sir.
You know what I mean.
You're afraid!
Thank you.
I hear you're meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
Right now we have to be practical.
Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
Dick...
All square, Doc.
...Don't you?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
Really?
He's a socialist, then?
I know.
That's a thought, Lil. That sure is a thought.
No, No arguments. Be my good girl and go. There's a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to do!
You can always come see it in London.
Boy, I'd love to... but I'm going to Hollywood.
No, I don't hate it.
...Not if I can help it.
You're wasting your time, lady. Nothing's off the record with me.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
Right again. You're no more an atheist than my man's a Red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for your Daddy.
I just wanted to see how you looked.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Yeah.
Well... don't you think it's up to me to...
Since when do you believe the papers? They killed him, kid.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
That's right.
...Take advantage of me.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
I don't know.
Right. Except... time has a way of --
Well... you're looking well.
Run!
Have you reported to your Probation Officer as directed?
Who're you?
'Golden Boy.'
But I want to. I'm trying!
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
Yes, Ma.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
Mama, what's...
You're taking me home!
What?
Go on...
Among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which... 
Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
What?
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
And he drove me to mine.
Why?
It can't be as bad as that.
Your crime... as well as mine.
You're wrong. Do you know I knew how to play this?
A companion. A female. Like me, so she won't hate me.
And if I consent?
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
Her body pleases me.
Quite right!
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
I should go. I should leave today.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
Is that what makes it so delicious?
I've no choice
I'm all right. I'm safe,
Now husband and wife.
Then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
He died. Raving about phantoms. He was mad, poor devil.  Gather a detail. Have the body removed from my cabin.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Thank goodness. We'd be out of work.
I resent God's monopoly.
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
You've been going round-the-clock?
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
What is your name?
Victor Frankenstein, sir.  Of geneva.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
It's utterly fantastic! This is the sort of thing I'm talking about! We should be learning this!
I heard.
Your men are right to be afraid.
Maybe I can help?
And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children...
Slipped in. Probably liked the scent of your perfume.
Absolutely.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
No. There must be some in the desk somewhere.
Some campers drowned. Then some counselors got killed.
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
Ned!
You? The brick?
Lead the way!
Umhummmmph.
No, thanks. I'm fine. Sandy.
One night on the town.
I mean...
Another coincidence.
What is your purpose in Mexico?
You said it was just you and your son.
Have you ever been there before?
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother's dead and he's not coming back, and it's all your fault. Twenty.
As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Pass.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Are you so much a fucking loser, you can't tell when you've won?
I don't give a shit about living or dying anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I can.
No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
Scott?
In the room. Were you serious, or were you just foolin' around? I'm just bringing it up, 'cause if you really want me to do that for you, I will.
What did I say?
Noooo!
I kinda doubt that. We're grabbin' a table, send over a waitress to take our order.
Shut up and start the car.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
No.
Did you even to try to negotiate?
-- This conversation is over.
Sight seein'.
How do you know?
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
It's not a big deal, unless you make it a big deal. Now, I'm real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with bullshit.
That's what you look like.
I'm here with you.
Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join us?
He needs our help!
Thank you, ensign.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Standing right here in my office.
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Don't worry about it.  If it's off your collar and out of your eyes, that's all I'm going to ask.
Smoke her.
Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether --
Jordan.  Might we do this over lunch tomorrow?  I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him.
It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am.
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO!
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
Come on, Montgomery...
She's a trainee, just like the others.  Why are you coming down so hard?
Just a coincidence?
Is this my glory, sir?
Spec-Recon.  Those guys are world- class warriors.  And they will not want you there, Jordan.
Which is guy-speak for...
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like...  Did I say he was class officer?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
"Yes, Jordan -- I'll wait for you no matter how long."
Not me.  You?
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
"Dad."
Are you hungry?  What's your favorite food?  We'll try to get it for you.
That your desk?  I'll take this one.
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Hmm.  Let's aim higher.
What?
Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me.
We know, Audrey.
Only one way to find out.
No, I'm into earthworms now. You wouldn't be interested. They're real "boring" creatures. Very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
Sure. I'd like that.
I have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
Your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than I did.
Oh my God! They're coming!
He was my college sweetie! Look at him. He looks so handsome on t.v. What the hell is he doing in Panama.
Nick Tatopoulos.
Your old sweetheart?
He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez.
What?
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
I want that story, Audrey. Remember you work for me.
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
Allez, allez!
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
Right. The worm guy.  Can someone get those people off the beach?
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
When I needed to catch earthworms, I knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. I had to draw them out.
No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
We've met before.
Sure.
Good luck on your mission, Sir. By Grabthar's Hammer, by the Suns of Warvan I wish you-
Like YOU know?
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
Am I crazy, or do you actually have something there?
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
As a matter of fact, I do. Look at their eyes. They're obviously nocturnal. Come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. So our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
Yes you did.
I have sectors 1-28.  I think Hector has the upper levels.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
What's  your name, son?
Okay...  Okay, now what.
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
No, no... I'll think on it...
Right.
Hopkins can't drink your bathwater Fred.
Oh I make it up. Use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
A LATHE??? Get off the line, Guy.'
You know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Tell them? About...
Well you have to tell them.  What if something happens? We're actors, not astronauts... We can't do this stuff!
Jason..
I thought It was the "We're dead" gesture! I was agreeing! Like I know where the hold button is???
No I don't. But I know somebody who does.
Gwen...
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Closer?  I can try.
You have ten seconds.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
We pretend...
Right. Long live... What's your planet?
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
NO, Thank God he has not.
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
We have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. The fault must lie with us, with the ship...
But there it is!...
And determination.
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
What does she see in them?
Over three hundred miles.
Congress has picked up it's skirts and is racing for Baltimore. They're not waiting for spring!  Of course, they still had time to deny my promotion.  Even John Adams voted against it...
The point being:  he's also a candidate for my job.  If we can pull this off, maybe I can restore their faith in me.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
Yes, general?
Hamilton, you're going to have to cover our asses as we cross.
Then use rocks!
I'll expect you for dinner this evening, Captain Hamilton.  For Christ's sake, have a bath.
They go back home to keep their families alive, stay into the spring to plant.  Then, they start coming back to us.
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
Lafayette is a child!
Of course the army will acquit him, that's not the point... Arnold is a man and will understand.  What I need to understand is, John, Sam... what is happening here?  Who are those people in there?  The fat ones in silk?
Gag on your own invention, then.
Detained by what?
What's the difference?
I... they look both the same.
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
Sir, these are our finest firearms from the armory at Charleville! They are a gift from the people of France!
To win this war I need an army.
Some things must never change.
I don't want to see your hospital.
I was born with a limp, sir.  The Militia used to hate it when I marches with them because my pike would always sway...
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
Yes sir, it's a wise idea...
They can use their imaginations.
Just because they are born?
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
You didn't have to shoot him, Bo. We coulda just beat him up some.
So... how many movies you been in?
He comes up here with our product. He suppose to come home with five hundred thousand dollars. He never shows up. Meanwhile, my sister's going crazy calling me all the time worried about him. Me, I just wanna know what happened to my focking money.
A zillion, huh? That's a lot.
I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
You must bring something heavy to the deal.
I wonder, would that work?  You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
She's... young.
That's all there is to it, huh?
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
I don't believe this.
Okay. Fine. The meantime, I'll just hang on to her for safe keeping.
You must be makin' some big deals, doin' lunch in a place like this?
All I want in return is to work on the movie with you. Fact I already got some ideas on how to fix it up.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
You say look at you?
I told them I was you. I acted stupid and they believed me.
Whatever you want, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
I know what a marker is.
You just did.
I mean, the way you told it to me. Start at the beginning, we see how the story line develops.
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
Who?
How'd you know he died, he tell you?
Yeah, well, maybe the guy took out flight insurance. Check with the wife.
Exactly. You either get it from the wife or out of your own pocket, I don't give a fuck. You don't ever hand me a book with a miss in it.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Martin. It was a beautiful role. All I had to do was find the character's center, the stem I'd used to wind him up and he'd play, man, he'd play.
Martin, look at me.
Like this?
Wow.  Mind if I take it for a spin?
Sit down, Leo.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
That's right. Three percent.
A real bargain.
What're you doing here?
Yeah, well make sure you lock it on the way out.
I spent all day crawling out of a grave. The costumer kept bitching 'cause I was ripping my nylons -
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
You were supposed to wait for me with Harry at the restaurant.
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
For starters, Marty wasn't Martin back then.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
That's a different story. I'm still working on that one, you know, getting the visual fabric just right.  Although I've added to it.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Oh.
Go get your stuff.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. Where do you sleep?
No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
What she did not say was, 'I just loved the way the director moved the camera so much it made me fuckin' seasick.' All she cared about was that look. All she remembered was that look. And why do we remember things in movies? Because we can see them.
Harry Zimm. You look like a wet kiss.
I don't hear anything.
I don't have a dog.
I know. I'm doing Shylock instead of a shylock. Okay, what's my motivation? The acquisition of money. To collect. Inflict pain if I have to.
A passenger liner. Over.
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over.
Yeah, a ship that's supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. You don't think that's just a little freaky?
Yeah. Hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? We call this in now, gonna be Coastguard, FBI, who knows who, all over the place.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
You find anything that even looks like a compressor. I don't care what, grab it.
Yeah.
Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions?
Bring it on, dude.
Maybe he isn't alone.
A what?
Right. Wednesday.
Yeah, yeah.
What is it?
Turbine rotor's shot.
How much longer's that gonna take?
We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
How long, then?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Not in the eyes of the law.
Yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
I guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
You smashed it!
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy.
Sorry.
Maybe twenty gallons an hour.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Lights?
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
You're more practical than superstitious.
Did you see him?
Epps.
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
But, who -- ?
Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
I don't know, are we?
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank.
It's a trap. There was no way we were gonna get away with that gold. Nobody ever does. It's just the bait. This ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
Looks like it's adrift.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
You've been out for about a day.
The mooring hasn't come taught.
Better late than never.
Fifteen, at the most.
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
How should I know?
Yup.
I made spaghetti. Do you want some?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
But I can't --
Oh, I just love this song! Isn't it great? Doesn't it make you want to dance? C'mon!
Dana! Hi!  Uh, Dana... this is Enid...
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Uh-oh.
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
Yeah, well... hi...
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
In fact, never.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
As always.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
I know a party we could go to...
Wait...
Where did you get that?
He gives me a total boner!
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
What thing?
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
What happened to Seymour?
Just some people from work...
Maybe an orange juice.
Who does?
Punk rock is over!
I did too!
Indian records?
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
So you really liked it? Yeah, there's some really rare performances. You liked that Memphis Minnie, huh?
Wow!
Oh God no. This is just junk I have for sale or trade. The record room is off-limits.
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
PLEASE? We have to!
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
Wait a minute! Hang on! Jesus, I gotta think of something to talk to her about. No! No...
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
What? Why?
What, like a girdle?
Maybe now you understand why I can't get a date.
That's the spirit!
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
Jesus, how can you stand her?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
I don't think I'm in any condition to drive.
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
Still torturing yourself over that Enid, huh?
Talk to us about it...
Right, exactly!
Why? What did she tell you?
She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
That slut!
Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
Yes?
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
And it worked?
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Beaumont says it's to end slavery.
Well, why not? You seem so calm and experienced.  Why not, indeed! 
Since you'd only been here three hours when we met, are you sure this is how you hunt lions?
So that's what a lion looks like. 
John, it will not be easy.
Somehow I guessed. 
I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means "slaughter"...
Good news?
I do, actually; very much.
Some Russian princes want to hunt the Himalayas. You?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
If this is what the world will be like, I don't want to live in it.
Occasionally
I won't.
Thank you.
Thank you, Frank.  Oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  I asked you last week.
His name is Oscar.
Peter, the bathtub tried to eat Oscar.
We'll take care of that.  Ray, Pete.  Listen, get over to Dana's right away ... Her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
For me it's best if I sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  If we go the other way I'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
Same difference.
Hi, Egon.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
We got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  Your name was first.
On a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, I sat on a throne of blood.  What was will be, what is will be no more.  Now is the season of evil.  Find me a child that I might live again.
I await the word of Vigo.
Maybe they just want to appeal.
I got you out of those bad tax shelters.
I'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. That ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  It's just a scared little baby, Sherm.
This is not just some money-making scheme!  I didn't just make up the date.  I have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on New Year's Eve.
From where -- Neptune?
This guy was a bad monkey.  He dabbled in all the Black Arts, and listen to this prophecy.  Just before his head died, his last words were, "Death is but a door, time is but a window.  I'll be back."
I'd put my money on that Vigo character.
No, the slime is rising.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Hold on, Ray!  Half-price!  Have you gone crazy?
What kind of tests?
You're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
Now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, I suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "Stabilize -- All Clear."
You finished here?
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
Groovy.  I've never felt better in my life.
So we'll put a warning on the label.
... I thought it was the drug store.
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
Like a used car salesman.
Thanks.  What's in there?
On a purely scientific basis.
I want to help you.
Goodbye.
Can't you tell me now?
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Take me now.
Yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  This one took some work.
This is preposterous!  I demand an explanation.
Definitely some sort of fighting Spaniel, I think.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Remind me not to go to lunch with you.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
Yes, it would.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Because you didn't say the magic word.
Well, because I'm curious.  I want to know more about what you do here.  Frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. For instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  Now either you show me what's down there or I come back with a court order.
Sorry.  This isn't your day.
Wow!
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
Let me guess -- Gozer Worshippers.
What do you mean by "seen?"
Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  I know what to do. Stay close.  I have a plan.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Fourteen hundred.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
Mmmhmmm.
Boy!  Solid cores of shielded Selenium .325.
Every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
But I get what I want, always, don't I?
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Do you want posters, too?
That this illness has clouded his mind.
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
Maybe it'll crush Gaius.
We can crush Gaius another way. What if you do throw something to the people they really want?  Make them a gift of food.
Take grain away from the army?
I wouldn't know who to bet on.
You don't want to kill him.  If anything happens to him now you will be blamed... and he knows it. Besides, that gladiator school is a fortress.  It would take the army to break in there.  What you want is to... offer him the wooden sword. If he takes it, he's no longer the champion of the people, is he?  He's gone.  And you are a hero for awarding it.
I'm mentioning you in tomorrow's athlete's section, legate.  So, I'd love to know your birth sign; it effects how people bet.  And perhaps you could tell me a bit about... well, who are you?
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
I believe we are arriving in an enlightened age; an age of peace that will bring Rome her greatest glory.  Thanks to Marcus Aurelius.
But have never been?
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
My loyalties... were in doubt.
Why do you play at being drunk?
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive.  All of them.
Commodus is just a young man, he'll learn what you had to learn.
Everyone talking about it?  I wouldn't wonder.  All I seek is a genuine balance of power between the Emperor and the Senate.  Thus I have transferred legal power -- which was theirs to begin with -- back to the Senators.  This includes a shared right to taxation too but some bite in the plan.  It's a start, only a start.  If the Emperor and the Senate can share power then the people will be ready to take their share.  This means Commodus has to bend; does he strike you as that type?
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
Marcus, you honor me, but I'm a soldier, politics scare the hell out of me.
It's your job as a Roman officer to disobey such a summons.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
They're studying with Cynics.
I can see that...
What you don't want to imagine is the things I've done.
Do you want to see Themis and Manto butchered?  If I die fighting Commodus he won't care about you. If I live I'll come and get you.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
They'll have me.  Teach them.  Don't let them become like these ignorant heaps of citizens without history, without philosophy, without meaning. Teach them of the Greeks, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, the Numidians, the Egyptians and the great Romans.  Teach them, who we are!
I'm a Greek, thank you.  And I was brought up believing Romans were the barbarians.  Give our new colleague some of the Cretan white.  Relax, tell me everything, I'm your friend.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
That's one way to look at it.
Alive... I'm alive...
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
A great deal.  They designed and build Tiger's chariot...
I want nothing to do with the arena.
Why not?
Yes, I do.
Yes.
But you're not enrolled.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
All right then! Yes!
Because it isn't true.
Then what?
The marble?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
Oh.
When?
Why wouldn't it?
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Ben.
Yes I am.
Plastics.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Right.
Benjamin?
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
What? No. Nothing.
Sir?
What?
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
No.
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
What?
Sit down, Benjamin.
What?
What?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
But they would! Don't you see?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Jesus Christ!
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Oh.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
What?
What?
Him?
I walk out.
We're talking.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
No.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
I don't.
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
No.
All right. Now let's get to bed.
How do you think.
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
I wouldn't know.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
What the hell have you done?
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
What?
When I go off?
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
But I don't want you to make up something.
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Swell. I appreciate it.
Yes, sir.
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
Mr. Robinson?
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Why?
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
Well?
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Need any help?
Have you got that skeleton key?
How?
I have an idea working in my head... 
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Very little.
Free --
You're very funny --
Money.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Why?
I feel sorry for him.
Yes --
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Certainly.
Yes -- tired...
So alone.
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone. 
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
Oh -- 
I'll not denounce you.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
For Vienna?
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Yes -- I will be on the train.
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Then you know him?
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Yes, quite.
If we could scare up some men to play.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again... 
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
If you occupied the room next to Madam Grusinskaya, you would appreciate the quiet of a hotel lobby.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
Oh!
Send his bags up to my room.
Oh -- but -- I --
You are ill.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, -- 
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
I never danced before -- in public.
Yes --
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
I'm the stenographer.
Me.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
Not too quickly.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
Shhh -- here he is now.
Yes, Mr. Preysing -- that's what we want to know.
Mop rags --!
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Next week.
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
You see -- what we are interested in --
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
What -- what is it? Last night...
Please.
Yes, the police must be called.
We must call the police, your excellency.
You are late. Hurry.
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
If the house is empty again, I don't know --
Have I kept you waiting?
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Good night.
You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.
I'll loan you a raincoat.
What's that, Lilly?
That's right. Take a little, leave a little.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Mary Beth, I hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.
Seven seconds. I don't see how you do it.
But what's wrong?
I'll get you a check.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
No?
I can't take that job! I mean, I mean, I can't take it right away. I'm still recuperating, I just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
Well...
Oh, sure. Fine.
Fair enough.
They twisted my arm.
Only one arm?
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
Sure.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
You do?
You, too, Roy.
I've really got to --
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
And Myra's stuff?
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
In your other hand.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
Because it's comfortable.
We'll rent a car.
What happened to Cole?
He retired.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
But the setup's there. It's there now.
I'm happy the way I am.
A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn't have that feel to it, but I'll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you for telling me.
You up to it now?
I'm sorry, that's an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, I'm, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn't an everyday occurrence around here.
Someone who knows her well could still identify her, that's not the problem. It's just there's, uh, it's likely to be a shock.
Oh, yeah. That's that.
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Right.  So why don't we get on with this investigation?
Charming.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
It's not historically accurate, that's all.
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
The dorms are only fifty feet away.  You could practically see into my window.  So, what difference does it make?
Or what?  You're gonna shoot me?
Any other psychotic relatives I should know about?  Jason?  Freddy Krueger?
Just get on the bus.
I borrowed it.
I can see that.  Why?
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's always John.
You're right.  It does sound strange.
I can't believe this is happening.
Do we have to invite him to the wedding?
Can't you?
I did alright.
You say, "The key to my heart," and I'm gonna hurl.
You're unbelievable.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
Kara? ... No, this is Beth.
Answer what?
I promise.
What the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
Who are you?
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
You're the only man for the job, Sam. Things haven't been the same since you left.  I'm recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  Old colleagues.  This is your change to finally make a difference.
No one's home.  Checked it out myself.
Sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  Yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. Somehow I knew you still had it in you.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
She has the gift -- the blood of Thorn running through her veins.  Michael's mother had it, too.  So for six years I incubated her, prepared her for this night.  Michael has served his purpose.  And soon we will have a new progeny.
Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
You know what gets me?
The time we were in a tree for fourteen days, you certainly tried to tell me everything about Mrs. Wheeler.
This room is full of ghosts.
You were rich before.  This is the first time I was ever rich.
What'll you do for transportation?
I'll buy a hundred more Cadillacs. Go home!
Go home.
Huh.
He and his love are like a retiarius.  Do you know what a retiarius is?
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
I didn't know we had any women left.
Every time I start thinking like that I get the clap.
You know her for what she is now-- garbage.
She was always a rotten wife!  She was against everything manly you ever wanted to do.  He was the most daring test pilot in the country at one time, and his wife made him quit.  She made him become a life insurance salesman instead.
Shut up, you ninny!  You were never to come here again-- for any reason whatsoever!
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
Would somebody please pass me the catsup?
What?
The doctor was called away on an emergency.  I think it was birth.
You think you could find me a pencil and paper?
She met him at college.
She has a master's degree in English literature.
He insults him all the time.
Tell me that.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Uck.
Don't care for cold steel?  A knife is worse than a bullet?
Sir?
Why don't you go to bed--son.
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Scat!
The smallest thing I've got.
Couldn't you have vanished quietly out the back door?
I am Harold Ryan, her husband.  I have killed perhaps two hundred men in wars of various sorts--as a professional soldier.  I have killed thousands of other animals as well--for sport.
Heaven.
Sir?
You are woman.  I know woman well.
Give us time.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Your old beau?
I was, I was.  It never lasts long.
He thought he could take my place. It is now my privilege to give an unambiguous account of why I don't think he's man enough to do that.
Say hello to your mother.
You'll get so you enjoy twitting weaklings again.  You used to eat it up.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast.  The cook quit yesterday.
You learned this in some college course?
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
The doctor.
And no one's there now?
I don't think so.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
Did you like it, dear?
He cried.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Like what?
That's really what you want.  You become furious when people won't make you dead.
We'll miss you so.
Neighbor!  Doctor!  I live across the hall.
Tough luck.  You'll have to split the fee.
She's crying because she's so happy.
Hundreds.
Quarantine, possibly.  You may be suffering from a loathsome disease which the American people could do without.  Goodbye.
There's a certain amount of information there.
You're old--so old.
Glands.  You're supposed to be happy when you die.  Call me comical again.
I've struck my blow.
With spittle?
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
It's trash now, like mine.
I'll put it in Paul's room, where it belongs.
You don't know?
You didn't even find that out?
Who's dead?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Kid--kid--
You sure misunderstood something-- and we'd better get it straight.
Thank you, kind sir.
A vacuum cleaner salesman and a fairy doctor.
Still lives with his mother.
How did she lose her feet?
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose.  As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
No.
What's his name?
For Heaven's sakes!
That man is your father.
Don't worry about it.
No!
Or was.  We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
I know.
We got a birthday cake, kid.  Did you see the cake?
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
Tonight's the night.
It is?
As long as he keeps out of the park.
We've got to dump Shuttle.  He brings his vacuum cleaner on dates?
I'm amazed.
Thanks.
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
It was almost worth the trip--to find out that Jesus Christ in Heaven was just another guy, playing shuffleboard.  I like his sense of humor, though--you know? He's got a blue-and-gold warm-up jacket he wears.  You know what it says on the back? "Pontius Pilate Athletic Club." Most people don't get it.  Most people think there really is a Pontius Pilate Athletic Club.
No.
That you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
Shit! You just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn'ta come.
You're going to thank me for this. You know what the media's like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
What do you mean?
That's cool.
Okay.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
Overpowering?
Yeah.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
You used to work at Copper Penny?
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
Shit.
More or less.
You wife isn't dead is she?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
Where is he, Niki?
You are.
That's right.
And better?
No.
I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy.  A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
Listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. You don't know what you're into.
How did you find me?
What plan?
It was called 'Slave of Love.'
What you got in mind?
You're talking about real excitement?
Take it or leave it.
You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
It's fifty cents admission. It's applicable to a purchase.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
That's all right.
No, take it. I don't want your Goddamn fifty cents.
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
In other words, you want to get laid?
You never heard of that?
I'm worried about Jake.
Huh?
Who's that?
Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
Isn't this your vehicle?
No, no. I just took it.
What kind of a car is it?
Edith, I'd like you to meet my son, Harold. Harold, this is Edith... eh?
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
No, thank you. I have my car.
Oh.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
It's very interesting.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
She seemed yare to me.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Me! No. Of course not.
That's really great.
You don't look eighty.
I don't know. Just one of those. 
What is it?
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Yes.
What were you fighting for?
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Why?
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
I thought eighty was a good round number.
It's true. I can't live without you.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
At a funeral.
Harold!
Well, actually, it was the name of my drama teacher - Louis Sunshine. Perhaps you've heard of him. He was such an influence on the development of my instrument. That means my body - in theatre talk. Well, when I came to Hollywood I felt the need to express the emerging me in a new form, so I took on "Sunshine." Dore is my real name... Well, Dore, actually. My, what a lovely place you have here.
No.
Yes.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
Yes.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
I knew you'd come.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
I'm your Daddy now, Kirsty.
No. You look...
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
Are you crazy?
Because I'm going to get my father!
I've come for my father!
Oh, excuse me...
The Cenobites.
Oooh!! Who was here? Nixon? Houdini? You mind sharing your mystic insights?
We don't take hints.
Behind this door. A dark entity -- Evil, ancient and hungry.
Didn't even buy me a drink.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Half transmission. Nonsense -- German ghost stories!
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
Your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
I worry about you.
That's not how she feels. She may never feel it.
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
It is. You got yourself on TV again.
Hold on -- hold on -- I thought we checked this place. Fakes, and reproductions.
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
Who?!
Don't tell me, it's Zeppo.
When we do: No mumbo-jumbo. Double- core Vulcan-65 grenades.
Each of us gets a belt.
You call that thing a cigar??
No, no, no, it's fine: I do my job, I take a break.
No. I never was.
Nah, sounds too "needy."
My uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
We're leaving.
Stay the fuck away from me.
I have to speak to my father.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
No.
Well can I come in or not?
I'm very happy.
You won't cheat me will you? You'll stay with me. Help me. Then we can be together, the way we were before. We belong to each other now, for better or worse...
A box?
Maybe.
I'm sorry, I don't follow. What was there to see?
We're going to freeze to death.
I don't know. Probably wanted a hideaway.
We'll sell it. Sell everything.
In here.
I cut myself.
O.K.
What are you talking about?
Plain soda?
No. No. Let's go upstairs.
No, not much.
Try me.
Steve.
I found a room.
O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
I've forgotten.
No. It's all over.
It's late.
Play it.
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
I didn't know it was classified information.  I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Suck my ass.
My band.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
No, you can't.
Oh, hi.
Uh.  That's me.
Right.  Why?
So.  Is now a good time?
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
Yeah but more than that.  I'm happy because I'm proud of us.  Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
I dunno.
Hi.
-- Alright, alright but --
But don't you remember?
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
I suppose so.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
Yeah.  Great.
Just ask it!
You really think it would make a difference either way?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home.  I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
I told you I slept with him.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Will you call me?
It's me.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
I don't want to.  Don't need to.  I love you.
God, that's a cold and a half.  Maybe you should bet back in bed.
Pig died.
Uh... No.
It'll have to be sex, then.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
No use.
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
Not really.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
I don't know.
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
Whiskey.
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
Right.
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
And after that?
Then what are you getting so upset about?
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Oh really.  You two are slamming to Nico now?
Whatever.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
I don't follow you.
Yes.
Grave robbers?
Probably.
No.  I had to talk to you.
You want me to front for you.
No.  Just the child of some lonely girl I gave a ride to.  When they died I put them in a grave with my name on it. Twenty years later I became the son.
I hope I never get that old.
My life has been chock full of people with complications and weak- nesses.  I can't stand it.  But you're different.  It's in your hands.  A clarity.
That's insane.
You and your buddy make a real team, don't you?  Exchanging eloquent threats in iambic pen- tameter while hacking up all the innocents in between.
Damn you.
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
All fashionably without heads.
Spare me the details.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
I've seen nobleman swords that weren't as well preserved.  It's just a hunk of peasant iron.  Why would he be carrying it around in an alley?
You'll not be bringing the church into this.
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
I'm twenty-two.
We are immortal.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
There is an imperfection.  For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat.  Then it is over.  The end.
Me arm hurts.
Again.  Try again.
Oh, the boy has a mouth, now if only he had an arm.
The Fabric of life.  The spark that allows the passing of existence from one generation to another.
This power is divided amongst you, me, and others like cuts in a pie. But the cuts are not equal.  Some, like you and he, have more.  Much more.
With the proper tools, Conor, a naive man can be much more dangerous than an evil one.
I have no future husband.
I don't know, Conor.  It's not natural.  Maybe something has touched you.
Like you.
Far away.
Kiss me.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
No doubt.
So sure?
Equals?
If you wish to play games, Major.
Have you time for some- thing to eat?
He's a MacLeod.
My father taught me.
He knows I'm here.  How?
Kahn?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
Head still secure to the neck.
I've had a few more concerns.
As you wish.
I want you to come to me.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
American.
Your murder weapon?
For the moment.
You're a kind man to be sure.
Same.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
No.
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Bon jour!
I'll come a-running, pardner.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
But --
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
Hello, Bruce...
Yes!
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
I see what you mean.
You haven't seen anything yet.
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
So long.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
That's the kind of stuff they want!
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
Out of the mouths of babes.
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
I have a lunch date. I just want --
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
I know. Where is he, I said.
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
We're going to take him over to my private office.  Where's our phone?
Huh!
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
Yes.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
I can't Hildy. It means my job! It means --
Me, too.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
I'll have it in a minute.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Little rum in yours, too?
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Earl Williams. The reprieve.
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
Hello, Olsen... Listen...  Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there.  Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Well, all right. But I'm liable to get into a jam.
I'm telling you!
What did you do with her?
Phone for you, Hildy.
I'll go right after it.
Well, Hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you wouldn't give this up so easily.
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
No -- what?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet?
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
How'd you get here, Earl?
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
What do you mean?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
Who do you think!
No, I don't think so.
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
Come on, fellas.
His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.
Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited.
She and Mollie were talking.
Your grandmother. She named them after virtues I lack. That's marriage for you.
The Germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
You couldn't.
Pauline.
I'm starting my own collection.
Well, for the baby, really.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Where?
Except the servicemen.
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
Bugger the Buffs.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
What's that?
Jam.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Father, that's enough now
And...and...Henry Chapman's girl, was it Thelma? No, I can see those cornflower eyes...I've lost your name, my sweetness.
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
How long?
And now we're glad you did.
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
I know I hate Swiss cheese, the holes make me nervous.
Cool.
If you keep going straight you can get back on the interstate... it's easier.
What? No, I'm was worried that... I was just wondering what's taking so long.
Nice.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
I dunno... we'll ask around as we get closer. Man, I really don't want to run out of gas out here in the middle of Petticoat Junction, man.
How awesome?
I'm not exactly sure... it looks close. Did we pass an abandoned school bus yet?
Fuck. I think we blew a tire.
Jesus Christ, Jerry.
Thanks.
Alright, alright. I know... I wanted to be the photographer.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Yeah, he's all hot on her after he found some of his dad's old nudie books hidden in the basement. He keeps 'em taped inside his school workbook.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
That's nice.
Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Shhhhhh.
Help, help us.
Well, don't take too long, the kids are already knocking down the door demanding their sugar fix... I know, I know I forgot to mention that Halloween falls on a school night, so they're trick or treating tonight... I got the joint decked out this year, built a graveyard in the front yard like when you were a kid.
Rise and shine.
Let's go. You're the one who wanted to be a photographer.
Maybe he's a cyborg.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Bill, why don't you ask her... she's your special friend.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Yeah, it's really your fault that we're stuck in this shithole in the first place.
Recover any bodies?
Yep, I suppose it is.
His name is Rufus, Rufus Jr., but we all call him R.J.
Um, I'm Jerry... that's Bill... Denise and Mary.
Well, I thought I'd maybe take in a hoedown.
Didn't ya think, Mary?
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
I appreciate your cooperation. I'm looking for a missing girl...  ...this girl here, Denise Willis... have you seen her?
I ain't sure that you really need to know. It's better you go home still dreaming about your kitty cats and puppy dogs.
Over here, inside the smokehouse.
I pray to God there is.
Call the chief... We found 'em.
Anyway, there's not much else out that way... so, I figure maybe there's a chance the kids broke down and found their way over to one of the farms.
That is the wrong fork, young man.
You decide. Today is your day.
When you were a little French girl?
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.
I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
What is it?
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
What an enchanting picture you paint of our future together.
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
That's what I'm counting on.
Always. Ow.
Shut up and tell me.
Handsome, thirties, psychologist...
What do you mean?
My brother is discreet.
Won't he be able to tell?
No. I married a midget.
Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
Rose, please go away.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
I have to say that I'm not there yet.
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing.  I've been seeing someone. A therapist.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
Nathan!
I'll be out in a minute.
Why certainly!
I don't think so.  Why?
I don't know. Something.
Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?
Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson.
Nothing. Be right out.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
It would just be helpful to know.
I'm just preoccupied.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
That's great.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
Have you?
Really?
Should I come with?
Nah. You just relax. How's the book?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
Oook. Oook.
Lila?
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines.
Comin' in or goin' out?
Right.
I've never been to Louisville.
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
Twelve thousand.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
You think I can lose?
I don't know when it was.
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
How much?
'Bout even.
How're the hands?
They're fine.
It's a long walk.
You want me to tell her for you?
Half.
You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken.  And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
Come up here to play straight pool with Minnesota Fats?
Why?
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
In the gut, I mean.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Talk to me, Charlie.
What's the difference where? I'll raise it.  Is it all right if I have another drink?
Aw, Eddie.
What for? To play Fats again?
Glad to meet you.
How much?
Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
Oh no, nothing for me.
A dollar on the five, two on the nine.
Yes.
No, not always.
What do you do on the other days?
At school. It's Thursday.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it.  Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one.  Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Is he a winner?
Well, he owns things.
Is that what makes a winner?
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
Leave now.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
No.
That is not now, human!
Yes.
Have you looked inside?
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Stay alive.
Yes.
That's fine.
Do we have to?
Is the hill ours too?
And that one -- to the right of Rigel?
It was -- it was -- it changed shape. First it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
I left it at work.
Good night.
No.
I know a way.
I'm not.  They must be tunneling under the whole town.
I know.  But you have a full day of school tomorrow --  You, too.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
Cool.
David? How'd you get this number?
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
He's not going to listen to me.
Better be. You left me for him.
Three years.
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
That's okay. You're driving.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
What was it, Roswell? You had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, Area fifty one. That's it! Area fifty one. You knew and you didn't do nothing!
I want you should know, I'm very proud of you, son.
We'll meet you there.
I don't hear no fat lady.
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
We're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. Atlantic Command is working on a type of visual communication.
Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
Please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? We don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  Not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
It's... slowing down, Sir.
What?
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
You know me...
Yeah, but what an entrance!
Butt-munch.
He's my angel.
I hear you.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
Above American soil?
Many worlds...
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
What do you want us to do?
Egyptian Mail. Morning edition.  Run!
Yes. My treat.
Where?
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
I'm going after Dad.
But don't you see? The pen is mightier than the sword.
It's war.
Schneider?
Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
How dare he?!
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
What?
You had it? You didn't trust me!
Knock it off. You're not mad.
Where is it? I want it.
But what are you doing here?
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
Yeah?
She talks in her sleep.
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
And do I detect a rebuke?
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
It's a new experience for me.
This could be close.
The penitent man is humble...
"J".
Junior?! Dad...
The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
But, Indy --
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
I remember first hearing your name when I was studying at Oxford. I am Chattar Lal, Prime Minister for His Highness the Maharajah of Pankot.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
There are no stories anymore.
The newspapers exaggerated the incident.
Okay, Shorty.
Two are still missing.
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
You do not believe me? You will, Dr. Jones. You will become a true believer.
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
What evil?
Poison never agrees with me.  Pull a right, Short Round, and head for the Wang Poo bridge!
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
It was destined that I came here -- and the future cannot be changed...
Stark naked? You wish... If you're trying to seduce me, Dr. Jones, this is a very primitive approach.
It's pulling me deeper!
Just one arm!
THE WHAT?!
Keep stroking it!
He'll be okay. He's a good kid.
Oh really?
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
Please -- oh please, I'm going to die! Get it off!
Willie, come here! Hurry up, we're in trouble!!
Down? Down there?! Are you crazy!
Yes.
No... they won't kill me.
Me.
This candid camera?
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
Where are we?
No.
That a new Datsun?
Then how'd I get here?
Loading a gun.
Are you crazy?
Of course you do!
Sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  Why don't I just take you back to UST?
I'll talk to them.
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
How do you act when someone trys to kill you?
We're a team...My...talent. Your... mobility.
Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
I'll sue.
What does it say.
Where are we going?
Gone where?
Send a man there. A secret agent.
I don't want to be you. I don't even like you, why would I want to be you?
Just get there.
The sand.
Where are you going? Wait!
A girl.
What?
Touch some part of her body. Trust me. It works.
Well you did it today.
What are you looking at?
But the rest is me. I'll dress like I want.
You want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
Who, me?
What glasses.
Don't get too cute.
How do you know?
Is that all?
It's not your time. I get time off.
That's good. It's not better. Where?
Osaka?
Run, stupid!
That's not funny.
Where are you going?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
Never mind, just say it.
Well at least talk it up, then. I feel like an idiot.
I can't handle that thing.
Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
What exactly?
I don't know.
No. She just stayed with us. Like she did all along.
You've changed your mind.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
That's nice.
GO-TOE. It's some islands.
JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
What part what?
Good.
Joe's escaped. Dieter's in him.
It's a long story.
Bit expensive, sir.
I have a new client.
Hey, sit in the car. I'll get you a fee. Make up for what you lost on the tour.
He's not an ordinary man.
It is to me too.
Your memory.
Sergeant Finnegan. Name's right there on the card. Are you sure you're alright?
Fine. You look fine.
Well what?
We're here.
Why don't you lie down until you feel better.
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Been hearing voices.
Then who did?
Blake?
It's not apparent.
I am sort of scattered.
That you're not crazy.
And how'm I doing?
You're doing...Okay.
Who do you work for?
To organize things. Meetings and travel...Whenever they come here, I handle details.
That depends...
They kidded me a little.
Did he put you up to it? Did he ask you to sleep with me?
Who did?
I'm leaving too.
He must be a good friend.
What'd he steal?
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Got to trust someone.
Hiroshima.
He plays it all the time.
We figure out if it's in here.
I know the territory.
What did you tell them?
For you.
I've never met anyone like you.
We just don't stop.
You are, I've seen you.
I know a nice island.
Tear it apart?
No?
Too much.
What's that outside, Daddy?
How long?
Three hours.
P.J.'s.
It's a smear campaign, Charlie.
Have them make their own calls. They'll find that these sources have a different story than the one that's in the dossier...  Push the deadline, Charlie...
Okay.
I don't know what he was thinking.
Get me to New Orleans this afternoon. I'll shoot the fucking thing myself!
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
If we could take a look, Mr. Wigand...
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Catch you later.
You're sure you want to do this?
Why?
I'm doing an interview.
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
..."ignition propensity?"  ...you understand any of this...?
I have to take a shower.
They're pretending it's process. Bullshit, it's foregone.
Oh, baby...
I got perspective.
Alright.
Area code 212-555-0199.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
Well, he may tape an interview with us. And, we believe if his testimony showed up in a court record first, it would free him up from his confidentiality agreement and give him some protection.
Yeah.
Okay. Thank you.
You eating with us?
Do you think we could talk about the taping? Tomorrow's taping, just so we can get it out of the way and order...
No, I usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.
In the real world, when you get to where I am, there are other considerations...
Yeah... Thank you.
What I've seen... I've liked.
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
Like what? Your sign?
I did not burn you. I did not give you up to anyone!
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
You came all the way down here to tell me that?
Like what?
Like where'd you work before Brown & Williamson?
It's obvious, isn't it?
Maybe that's just what you've been telling yourself all these years to justify having a good job? Having status? And maybe for the audience, it's just voyeurism? Something to do on a Sunday night. And maybe it won't change a fucking thing. And people like myself and my family are left hung out to dry. Used up! Broke, alone!
They get to go home at night. What does it cost these people to do this to us? Nothing?! My girls are crying, so fuck them! I want to tape! I'm done thinking about it.
...they "volunteered." A friend owns a large security company.
I fought for you... and I still fight for you.
She's okay.
Now, they tried to get the Mississippi Court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...  However, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the Kentucky gag order...
It acts as a...
Mr. Scruggs, Jeff Wigand. Lowell Bergman said I should give you a call...
That's why we hire scientists...
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
-- and we are sure...
Here's her picture...
Who's the pigeon?
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
I don't need it.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
What?
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
And you've always loved him?
Miles?
Marylin? When did I say...?
No. Don't stop.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
Your mother was.
No, we're not!
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery.  It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
I bet.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
You do? You do love me?
It's okay Joe.
Income tax evasion?
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
We were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
Like I know his intention? Or yours for that matter?  I should join Sam. I'm too old for this bullshit.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
I want to be exposed.
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
A yert.  Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Ha Ha.
Oh brother. Here we go.
I don't have a pre-nup
Mm.
But then... But then...
Ah.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
And she has...?
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
No. You're not.
Miles -- why so angry?
Miles.
No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
Who's "Patty."
Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing "Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe.
Well, not just divorce. She used to say "I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true.  I'm happy for you Patty
Muriel Rumsey.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
South America!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
You only met him once .
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menparticularly if you're a shining example.
Nothing. 
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
Fine man to fall in love with.
I suppose so.
Why should she? After all
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roadsall transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
What're you gonna do about the papers? Somebody's gotta pick 'em up.
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it.  Here's your ticket.
What are you talking about?
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy?
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
I can't go out like this.
Nope. No complaints.
Next week "East Lynne."
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this.
What do you meanstarvation?
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature.
Mind your own business.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Eat a carrot.
If you do, I'll break your neck.
What'd you give him for the car?
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
Come here, you little fool!
Whome?  Want to see me?
Won't I ever see you again?
Thank you.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
What's that?
Yes?
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that?
Up yonder. See the lights?
Huh?
Okay, Joe. Listenyou know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turnanytime I ran into a story that looked goodI always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
ain't got a hat
Mush. Mush.
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see?  A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball,[10] is what I always say.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Yeah ?How do I know?  I gotta good mind to plug you.  I shouldn't take any chances on you.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
"Threat to assassinate President Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, November 22-23.  Information received by the Bureau has determined that a militant revolutionary group may attempt to assassinate President Kennedy on his proposed trip to Dallas, Texas, etc, etc..."
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
There were no phone records.
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
I think I'll cut out here, chief.  I gotta get home.
You may not like this, chief, but you're beginning to act paranoid.  I mean, you really are.
Grab your socks and pull... Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw...
Maybe I have a little more respect for this country's institutions than you do, Susie.  You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going between the Mob, the CIA, FBI, and Army Intelligence and who knows what else, when you know you can't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people!  We got leaks everywhere! We're going to trial here!  What the hell do we really got?  Oswald, Ruby, Banister, Ferrie are dead.  Shaw - maybe he's an agent, I don't know, but as a covert operator in my book he's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality.
Pretty fast, wasn't it.  The way they let him go.
You're not digging.
...well the party got crazier and crazier, one of those, y'know "beatnik" type things.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
Where you going, boss?
There's a word - orders.
I don't doubt their involvement, Bill, but at a low level.  Could the Mob change the parade route, Bill, or eliminate the protection for the President?  Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back?  Could the Mob get the FBI, the CIA, and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation?  Could the Mob appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up?  Could the Mob wreck the autopsy?  Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38's for hits, up close? The Mob wouldn't have the guts or the power for something of this magnitude.  Assassins need payrolls, orders, times, schedules.  This was a military-style ambush from start to finish... a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings.
This is Louisiana, chief.  How the hell do you know who your daddy is? 'Cause your momma told you so... You're way out there taking a crap in the wind, boss, and I for one ain't going along on this one.  Jim sighs, saddened.  Bill was one of his best men.
What did they...
It leads farther than that.
Dave, just calm down.  Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes.  I'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name.
What do you mean?
How could I?  Dave, as you know, President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday.  A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby.  We've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we've been advised you knew Oswald pretty well.
What was so appealing about Houston?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
In the morning we went goose hunting. Then headed home, but I dropped the boys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond.
Why?  What's wrong?
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
Because of Kennedy?  Are the same people gonna kill us, Daddy?
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
No, I saw a guy shooting from over there.  He was behind that fence. What are you going to do about it?
A Willie O'Keefe?
No.  I have never known anyone by that name.  Of course never having met Mr. O'Keefe I could hardly have met Mr. Ferrie...
Of course not!  Such a pity, that assassination.  In fact, I admired President Kennedy.  A man with true panache, and a wife with impeccable taste.
I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job.
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
I don't think so, Jim...
Call me Willie.  I ain't got nuthin' but time, Mr. Garrison.  Minutes, hours, days, years of'em.  Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin' itself in the road...
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
Upstairs.  In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence, Banister, before he was FBI, was ONI.  What do they say?
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
How many men?
The Warren Commission call him?
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
Sure, three experts and not one of them could do it!  They're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual bolt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin' to his Marine buddies he got Maggie's drawers - he wasn't any good.  Average man would be lucky to get two shots off, and I tell ya the first shot would always be the best.  Here, the third shot's perfect.  Don't make sense.  And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times. One "pristine" bullet?  That dog don't hunt.
No, it can't!
Any chance of one of them confessing someday?
It never did. 
You have other information?
I didn't say that.  All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out.
The assassination, Jack?
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
I expected that two months ago, and they're wasting their time... The bad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years.  Well, maybe that's good news - it was never as good as combat, but this is.  Bill, any more on Oswald and Shaw?
That's all you've had all this time?
And what would I have to do?
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
That sounds fun.
Yes.
Won't forget?
I won't forget.
Who was there for your ass?
What'd ya mean?
Let me finish. Can I finish?
What the fuck I tell you. You don't hafta shoot nobody. Just hold the gun. They'll get the idea.
I went to give him his refund, so he wouldn't have to come here.
Hey, Jackie.
She knows it's my case?
Oh, you're both? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted for carrying drugs. You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours. He did time and you got off. But that ended your career with the big airlines. Cut to thirteen years later. You're forty-four years of age. You're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is. Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year. That ain't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career. And to top it off, you're going to jail. Now true, the judge, even with your prior, will probably only give you a year or two. But this doesn't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away.  Now, we don't like trying losers like they're criminals. But in the absence of a criminal, we will try you. Now, wasn't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker?
What's in it?
Take your time.
In cash.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
Great.
Shit.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
Same as you. Ten thousand.
Well, Jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.
Black's fine.
It's nice.
It's not really something I think about.
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
"American President"
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
She's adorable. But I had to end it.
Bring the money in and they follow it?
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
What? If I was in Nicolet's place?
If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money, would I take it?
A half-a-million dollars will always be missed.
But you still have to show him the money at the airport.
Uh-huh.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Not after they're dead.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
Can I smoke?
If I'm working, I can help you.
A Broadway shopping bag.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Uh-huh.
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I have no idea.
If it'll make you happy.
I sure hope you haven't done anything dumb Jackie.
So what happens now?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
Buy ya a beer?
Beaumont Livingston?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
Keep it between us girls?
I was expecting you. Come in.
And what was your answer?
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
Can you cover that?
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
Managers get ten percent.
I'll give ya ten.
I can do that.
What'd you care?
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
I thought you were sixteen.
Where were you?
Did you ever go I one?
You lived in Japan, when?
We shoulda been there already and we woulda been if it hadn't been for your fuckin' around!
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
I get out. Spend the rest of my life spending.
That was Beaumont.
An employee I had to let go.
What did he do?
I told you, man.  She my fine little surfer gal.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
Melanie must be dyin' to see it.  Louis.
Couldn't talk to her?
Maybe a minute. She came right out.
Fuck you for asking me that.
Pull the car over.
Then she throws forty thousand in here, to rub the shit in my face, know what I'm saying? She wants me to know she ripped me off.
Tell me.
I didn't really think anything of it. No -- I did wonder what he was doing there, but didn't think it had anything to do with us. You know like maybe he was there with his wife or girlfriend.
You know the motherfucker's a bail bondsman, don't ya? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell?
Gonna have to put up cash.
You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I?
Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out.
That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money!
Jackie ain't got time for all that shit --
Just listen for a second. We got a forty-year-old, gainfully employed black woman, falsely accused --
Winston found you.
Well, bully for that nigga. You say she wants to give me the money, huh?
In a way, yes.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
Turn left.
I know where to turn.
No.
I was gonna tell you...
What isn't happening?
It's all been a dream.
You know, I've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. Nothing penetrates that night. Nothing.
He was upset. He thought people were following him.
Frank. It's Jake. Jacob SInger.
They're not interested, Jake.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
I am.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
I'm too messed up to teach.
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
A doctor? And what's he gonna do, tell me I'm crazy? They've fucked with my head. I've got to prove it. You've got to do something.
Cars don't explode that way. Any simpleton knows that.
I can't relax.
What?
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Ah. Neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... I always admired that.
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Oh, that goes way back. They had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. Bad timing for me though. Middle of the war. The draft.  I'll tell you Prof, after Viet Nam ... I didn't want to think anymore. I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
Well, try not to get burned. You have a great mind, Jacob. Don't let anyone tempt you away from it.
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
Hell, you think I am?
That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
I don't know. Santa Claus. I had my son's picture in it. Gabe's picture. It's the only one I had.
Don't ask.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
How's it going?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
They weren't human!
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where's Della? Bring her here?
Hey, I'm here.
It's gone to the top.
What kind of man are you?
Jezzie! My feet are throbbing!
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
How?
I tell you, it was so wonderful. I felt like a little boy. I saw Paradise, Jezzie.
Stick with me, kid.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
With wings.  You transport me, you know that? You carry me away.
You've lived with me for two years.
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
Stop it, Jez. Don't do that.
Where have they gone?
That's what they called it. A fast trip right down the ladder.  Right to the primal fear, the base anger. I'm tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. But I don't need to tell you. You know.
I don't believe this. It's a miracle, Michael. A miracle.
No. I couldn't.
Save the words ... Just send back my credit card.
If you're lucky.
Call my chiropractor.
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
The army?
Blew up? What do you mean it blew up?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Okay. My husband's got two more bags. He's coming. They're heavy.
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
If we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
He came for me, I had to run!
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa.
But I didn't see...
Fuckin A...
Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!!
Yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  Last chance.
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
Old woman?
I'd want her statements before we reach porch. Jesus, women.
Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right?
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
You need to get laid!
In twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
Good point.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
I missed you too.
We're missing two of the kids!
No! He's coming with us!
Thirty seconds.
JASON?! WHERE IS HE?!
I didn't say he was alive.
More soldiers?
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
You're crazy!
Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
He's from the Oceanographic Institute.
What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand?  Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
C'mon. Middle appendix --
Where...?
Have you ever had one do this?
Don't be silly - You're going to make summer better for them...
Nothing to worry about -- I'll survive this.
August! Tomorrow is the 4th of July, and we are going to open for business. It's going to be our best summer in years. If you're so concerned about the beaches, you two, you do whatever you have to to keep them safe, but with you or without you, the beaches stay open this weekend.
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
Forget it. This summer's had it. Next summer's had it. You're the mayor of Shark City. You wanted to keep the beaches open. What happens when the town finds out about that?
The best interest in this town would be to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head. You do the right thing. You authorize me.  Right there. Whatever it costs.
No, it was local jurisdiction.
He ate a car?
Sometimes.  Look here -- something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. And staying right with us.
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
Why don't we just tow it in?
There's no limits to where he can strike, and we've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days. It happened like this before, in 1916, when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach, in Long Island.
I wish it would rain...
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
Worthingsly... Worthington -- no one ever died on me before.
Oh, no, sir. I've never had a woman do that. I'm sure she drowned.
Some friends and me took a house.
What's going on with the beaches, Chief?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Martin hates boats. Hates the water. On the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. He's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.
He's busy.
I've got all these signs here...
Transplants?
And I'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark. I'm talking about a Great White.
Let me see your hands...
Who's inside, you or the shark?
And I'll drink to yours.
I don't think so.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
I don't mind. You definitely bring something to the table.
Um, hi?
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
Yup.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
Cool it.
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
No Josh, I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Yeah.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
When was this, like '96?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Why?
Nope. We're safe.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
What are you?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
I heard that was you.
Sure.
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
Nothing...
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
There are ads? For parents?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Keith's hot.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
Or you could just wait a couple months. It's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls.
I just think it's too early to paint. That's my opinion.
What?
...Thank you.
Karma.
No it is not!
Hold still.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
What'll we do out there?
Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here...  Do it Adele... Now!
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
...Too bad.
Who?
Dahlia, no.
Now why is that?
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him.
I heard that.
Look again!
I don't know.
Nervous?
No.
Without his car?
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
Did what take?
I can tell that she had just entered puberty.
And there was this picture of her painting Easter eggs or something. And I said, you were cute when you were little.
And she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. I look younger without my makeup.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
What do you mean?
I don't know, he quit dealin' but I'll bet he'll smoke us out.
Probably.
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
Yeah. The way I see it. My outlook on the this situation is.  It's like getting fame, you know what I'm saying. It's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Yeah.
Well, those guys share everything, right?
And once I saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. Where they lived the other's life for a day. You know those guys share everything, right?
Who?
She hangs out at Nasa. She promotes for them.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
So. You never know when you can end up like that.
Shut up.
Yeah.
Nuffin' G. Just forget it.
Right now?
You were?
Tonight?
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Come on.
Nothing?
I wouldn't believe it?
What things? I'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  I want to make you happy. That's all.
I guess so.
What?
Telly's not here right now. I believe he went downtown. Casper too.
I know.
You didn't?
Passion...
Whah is dissdee?
It's like...
Oh shit.
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
Yeah I get bored.
To come?
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
Yes.
He says it's a game.  All games have a strategy.
That's right.  I guess only the killer would know that.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
Well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
There's a photostat of the original on the wall.
Homesearchers.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
He's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
Check with the State.  If he's never killed outside of Washington the F.B.I. wouldn't have it.  Nolan?
It's a voice modulator.
You weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
Oh, c'mon.  We're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  It doesn't mean anything.  It's Sanderson!
Did you know her?
You're not going to tell me that.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
So is mine, within the framework of my rules.
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
She's in the other room.  I just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. But it's time for her to die now.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
You don't understand.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
No problem.  We're in.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  Jesus, Alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
Don't patronize me!  You sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
My cheering section.
You want to sleep in my bed tonight?
Thanks, David.
Any sign of rape?
It could have been a tape.  A prerecorded conversation between Sanderson and himself.
Anything else?
Meaning?
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
I've got a room at the institute I use when I stay late.
But he had to dump the body there to make the move.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
This is insane!  Can't you see what's going on.  The killer wants me out of the way.  He's setting me up.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Is it serious?
You're always in the middle of a match.
Mate in five.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
Uh huh.
I've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  I don't have the patience for it.  When did you start playing?
It seems like such a complicated game.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
You sound like my mother.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
She died in a car accident.
Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
You really haven't seen my best side.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
Because she killed herself!!
Maybe you're afraid of what it says.
Well, you're beautiful.
<u>What</u>?
Well, then you can go up to the parapet and I'll hand the buckets up to you.
I don't have to look around. I've found the husband I want. You can kiss me now.
All the passages are guarded.
I knew you would come.
Of course it was.
Your powers are greater than you know.  Have you ever seen one of these?
But there is another entrance to this place.
Lyssa ... Lyssa ...
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
She can see the Beast!
No! You cannot know that!
I have need of friends.
And in the few seconds before I dice you to crow-food, tell me why I am going to follow you.
I compel no man to follow me on this journey.
We must try to get horses.
Well, it is true that if I received a royal command I couldn't very well disobey it, could I?
Naturally.
Perhaps. If the pay is good.
Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
You can have half.
And do you think I live on air?
We have plenty of hares.
No. He will master the leader.
Then look!
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
He will not come. You will be my queen.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
It is the way of all invaders. Those they would conquer they divide, buying allies with promises of land and power.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
Sixty at the needle, another thirty in the forest. Only ten of us made it back.
With an old voice?
It is the time.
That creature helps no one. And none who go there return.
That is true.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
But you would not stay with me.
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
No?
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
Good.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
...Because I feel it.
Why?
I never rent my gear.
...OK.  I love you anyway.
A little...
I love you too, and I don't want to lose you.
Of course! I'm fine!  I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up...  I tried to get beautiful!  Don't you like it?
...Don't you like me?
...I don't know.
Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
...I got lost, Mister.
...One second.
Because you have to pay.  It's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. It's the rule...
Emilio? Due grappe!  ...Why the hell did you come here?
It's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  It really isn't the usual procedure...
Why am I such an authority?
High-top Nike Cross-Trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  They're nasty.
No it's not.
Maybe later.
Thank you.
I mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
You do?
You have?
Okay.
You should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
There was no card.
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
I don't follow.
Then why?
No.  But I want to take a walk with you.
I see.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
Why so vague?  Why so evasive?  He could be somebody hot.
That's me.
Where?
She wasn't certain... I never really showed her.
Because I should have shown her before... Everyday, I should have shown her.
What Mr. Parker?
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
What do you mean?
Evening News?
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
No.
Are you working?
That's funny.  I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Are you serious.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Thank you. What time is it?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Be careful.
Can we just ignore it?
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Suits. I didn't tell them anything. You know anything about gears?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
His dead body with a bullet in it.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Not really. I know how competitive it all is --
I'm a man who knows what I want.
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
Was she carrying a weapon?
-- uh --
What'd you do?
Which must be a nice vacation for his balls...
Uh -- family.
I know. He has it sent out.
Did you know he got wait-listed when he applied? His father had to make a call.
He's already got his coffee -- maybe he needs a donut.
Yes, you are.
Yes, he is.
You think?
Well, I don't want to look like I know what's coming...
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out?
I wasn't gonna --
Uh, for starters, she won't give us an alibi --
If she were a true blonde, she would've left the cheating bastard. Blondes don't let their husbands get fellated by brunettes and live to tell about it.
What?
Really --
You're applying for my internship, aren't you?
She could make you drop three pounds in one class. She's completely gifted!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
I just don't want to see you get your hopes up. You know how you get.
I'm covered in very expensive Egyptian mud -- hardly naked.
I' m sure that was very awkward for Chutney.  Much as it is for me, hearing you tell about it.
Where's the Rock?
It's not a Theta --
You're right. Phew!
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
What do you want from me?
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
Or looked so beautiful...
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Oh no... Don't you understand?
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
The flower.  Bluebells.  To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
Well spoke.  True to the mark.  And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
What does she want from me?
Don't you know?
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
There must be an answer somewhere.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
And if she thinks me a liar?
Knaves and robbers...
Something's coming.
Aye!  That too.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Whatever for?
Beware.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned.  A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
There's the way, mates.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
We'll find it.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
Defend ourselves.  We've bested far worse already.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted.  Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Might not need a gesture quite so grand.  What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
That's it then... the ring!
I'll try.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
They'll do nicely.
Sorry.
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
Are you honest?
Jack!
He did run?
Tis the truth.
Oh, la...
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
I have no wife.
What if I answer yes?  Will my wish come true?
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
And I... love you...
Lili... I love you!
Biting you?
Pinching me!
Thought the weather terrible of late.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
How do I get the horn back?
What became of the princess?
Princess?  I know of no princess.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak.  My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins.  There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
I'd be honored.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
I would have anyway.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
What color?
You'd better call and cancel.
I couldn't sleep last night.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb.  Why did you do that?
What did you think it would be?
Why?
I don't want you to!
What are you talking about?
You're driving me crazy!  Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality.  I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
how much weight have you lost?
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Forty.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Uh huh.
Not a shower.
He escaped.  He's going back in.
I'll ask.
I'll be around to check up on you.
You have everything?
Mom...please.
Goodnight.
I warned you yesterday.
Hey...hey!
Oh, okay.
Sit down for a second.
I won't ever hit you.  I don't want you smaller.  I want you to be happy.  You're not.  Not here with me. Not home with your mother.  Not up in Tahoe.  Not alone.  Not anywhere.  You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes.  In your sleep. In your answer to everything.  You're barely alive.
I know.  Why?
What would you like to be?
Nothing.
I gave up on you.
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
After everything.
What's wrong with your back?
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  Maybe everything happens for a reason.  Something bad to force something good.
I still don't know what that means.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
I haven't been touched in years.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
God, you look like crap, George.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
A blueprint spool.
What did you do with your dog?
But you can't call me while you think?
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
No, I'm...thanks.  I took something.
This was my very first slow dance.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
I'd rather you not be here.
What did I say?
You need to know what?  Do I still love you?
You got the money?
Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
I'll make you something.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
Take it off.
Okay.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Better make it a week.
Is Mae Rose okay?
And the baby?
I'm talking about a haircut.
Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.
Why not?
Nice girl like you don't belong in a place like this. But if you talk to Sylvia, tell her old Claude said congratulations.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Ten dollars. But I need it to get home.
Damn straight, it is. I got my own set of keys because I'm supposed to open up. So if I ain't there 8 a.m. Monday morning, there's gonna be hell to pay.
No, tell me what's so funny.
Hey, you'd be surprised what you find in other people's pockets. Just gotta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers. Get you every time.
You need collateral.
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Okay then, I'm gonna walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie.
Here I am.
Guess we better get going, huh?
While you were upstairs doing God's work, I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes.
Winston. His name's Winston.
Claude.
Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that.
I'm serious, man. Don't mention it. Ever.
The hell you talking about? What train?
We're in the Bronx, my man. Hundred and Sixty First Street.
Red Sox... Who's on the mound?
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
You get ketchup?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
That was five years ago.
Some faces you just don't forget. Warren Pike's is one of 'em.
I said you're soft.
They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey.
Well, if you must know, they could be closer.
I'm sorry, he's on medication...
Made just for you, Cookie.
C'mon, Goldmouth, somebody's gotta watch the front door.
Nothing to it, really. Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue. They got a couple of crackers working there don't know their asses from their elbows. Then they was gonna set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those bodies was them that got stuck inside. Claude figured during the commotion, it wouldn't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning.
Hey, where's Claude? I don't see Claude!
Thank you, Claude. That'll be all for tonight.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Shoot him, Wilkins!
Anybody else need anything read?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch. Help wash down all them pills they'll be giving you.
You found him.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
Maybe we will. Nice meeting you.
Puerto Rican rum. See for yourself.
You shouldn't have come here.
Why should it end? Who's gonna stop us?
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
Try an angel.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
Put it in your mouth.
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Definitely.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
You got it.
Of course you do, Tommy Tune.
Little nervous. Wanna puke.
We know where to find Nicky.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
What?
I have to, Valerie.
Yeah. The deep South.
Yes. I would like my flask back.
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
All right -- what are you?
Nude. Imagine, a pair.
Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you!
Not in my time...
Just wondered... what happens?
Well, why not!? That's exactly how everything works. How else could the city stay in balance -- You have a better idea?
Only a few? You're just not trying.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
No.
You felt sad. What's your name?
How a Sandman lives.
I'm afraid to tell you.
You're years away... I don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  Want to try?
It's different now. Help me.
How can I?
I don't..
I wish I knew what you think I know.
You're not going, are you?
Uh-uh.
When did you begin to question Lastday?
Let's see -- how long has it been?
I -- I can't.
I'd rather take my chances with them... than with Francis.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I had to. I did kill... for the first time in my life I killed.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
It could be...
You want there to be one... that doesn't...
You're lying! You'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! You'll be killed the moment you're seen!
Of course.  I don't know where...  I just took them for granted.  It's our only chance.
Are you sure?
I don't know... but it does.
At least it's over...
Have any other people ever passed through?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Alive?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
Too little.
Good... You up for a drive?
No, I'm okay.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
It's me...
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Andy?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
We killed him.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
What's up?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Did you tell the police this?
Out in back.
Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
Did you ask him who he is?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
A headache?
The first night... Not the last two.
No, no. I want to go in.
Aspirin... fly head. I gotta have more aspirin.
Of course. In fact, I'm there right now.
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
The heart, I guess.
Eight, nine car lengths. A hundred and sixty-two feet.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Yeah... How ya doin', Pete?
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
I always get it twisted because I'm left-handed.
Look at me. Look at what they gave me to wear.
As a matter of fact, I'm very good at double solitaire.
Have I?
Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
You were asked to have a glass of wine. Sit down!
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village
Not for me, thanks. No, I'm too weary.
Over by that hill.
Leaving?
Well, no. You see, I got this plumbing business
In time you will meet them all.
We find, in the Valley, it makes for better happiness among the natives. We rule with moderate strictness and in return we are satisfied with moderate obedience. As a result, our people are moderately honest and moderately chaste and somewhat more than moderately happy.
Only very rarely. You see, it would not be considered good manners to take a woman that another man wanted.
Well, in that event, it would be good manners on the part of the other man to let him have her.
When was all this?
Well, they didn't actually mean that.
The only one.
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
No porters here!!
No.
Why, no.
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
As far away as I ever want to be.
In that respect, you are exceedingly fortunate. We are expecting a shipment from them almost any time now
I thought the porters had instructions from the High Lama not to take anyone.
Father Perrault is dead.
Sit down, my son.  You may not know it, but I've been an admirer of yours for a great many years.
Yes.
Yes.
Huh? Oh, sure, Freshie. Good thing, sleep.
It means we're in unexplored country - country nobody ever reached.
We've had plenty of it the last few days.
You talk as though you intend on staying.
What are you talking about?
Did I say "if"?
Shhh!
Porters?
Why - I'm sorry - but I
What else can I think after a tale like that?  Good heavens, Bob, things like that don't happen today. We're living in the twentieth century.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
It's no place for you, Bob. Think of what's waiting for you. Do you want to stay here until you're half dead? Until your mind starts corroding like the rest of them?
Enough! Never mind the girl!  Well, why don't you go?
George, you couldn't possibly stay here, could you?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
She's going with me.
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
Yes, everything!
That fellow got on at Baskul.
You mean to tell me you're not going to do anything until we land?
That was easy. I read your books.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
On the contrary, you're not strange. And that in itself is confusing. I have the same idea about Shangri- La. The sense that I've been here before, that I belong here.
I wonder.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
Why?
Please say you will. The days are so very long and lonely without you.  Please . . .
Hesitated, sir.
I guess I lost:
And if I say yes?
Yes, sir.
Actually, sir--
All the time, sir.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
She didn't even know you. .
I think you're too used to it.  If you ask me, you've been doing this job too long.
It's an Edna named after Zed's ex wife.  All you do is at the target. The scope matches the image with the image on your retina. The barrel will find the target on its own.
No. The aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. They made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
Kay!?
What is it?
No.
How could it not?
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Yeah, I'll talk to you.
Yeah, Kay?
Wouldn't happen to be the Lincoln Memorial, would it?
Will it lower the curve?
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
The what?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
What the hell is going on?
Elle's up in Portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a Trailblazers game.  Shots got a lot to mop up.  Tee says his Shanghai quadrasectionals haven't been around since morning.
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
That and, well... I want my friends to see me on CNN.    Okay, I will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  We'll gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
Anderton --
You were right.  I'm not being set up.
She died?
Right.  I know --
And put them out.  Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?  The future is much more interesting than the past.  Don't you think?
The nano... what?
Kill type?
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
Try again.
Has the observer from Justice shown up yet?
Don't apologize, John.
I'm fine.
I'm fine, Lamar.
Can you fake the cerebral output?
You can't run --
Beauty?  The precogs don't even always agree with each other!
No doubt.
Then go ahead, pull the trigger.
Did Marks close the front door?!
We're in motion on something.
Because it was going to fall.
Yes.
Really?  You've never been inside?
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
But you call this room the "temple".
There hasn't been a murder in six years.  There's nothing wrong with the system.  It's perfect.
Possession alone will cost you six months, not to mention your badge.
She said...
Do I know you?  Who are you?
Oh... Hi, John.
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do!  And I swear, I didn't do any of the stuff I did!
No.  No way.  I wouldn't even know where to begin!  Those thoughts about my cousin Elena -- they were just thoughts. I would never --
So?
I guess that's all of it.
Sean --
You're not gonna kill me...
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
So you won't help me?
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
He's dead, Lara.
Then how did he --
Not quite.
I did find it.  It was inside of Agatha all this time.  So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?
Yes... It's called an echo.  The act of murder is such a violent disturbance in the future continuum that it sometimes repeats to the Precogs.
We teach the tech's to identify them and disregard...
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
Because he thinks he's innocent.
We can stop him.
I don't know, why?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
What kind of cop were you before this?
I was a Treasury Agent for eight years.  Why?
None.  This was arranged.
The man across the street.  I've seen him before...
Yes.
He's not here now, is he?
Yes.
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Not very well, I'm sure.  I'd probably start doping myself.  Or maybe I'd...
I haven't seen him in two years.
But there's still the other two.
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
We have snifters
I can take you down there.
Yeah 'women.' If I was a fag I could get laid in a subway.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
He's great, right. Is he great?
Bullshit.
No more.
She's, uh, sleeping.
He's not doing it.
Where were you?
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
Go.
Ho's a good guy --
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Your dance is over.
What's your record at?
Yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
It's bad. Before you even showed up, he said you were Maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. He wanted to TCB alone. I was gonna ride shotgun to keep the English dude above board. Now he's spooked. This shit's snowballing.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
He must have that shit troughed.
What do you mean 'troughed?'
Where's Ricky?
Last time, maybe, with the Puerto Ricans, but these were nice Jewish boys.
That prick tried to get Jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
You told him you liked him.
He'll work it off.
I don't know the kid, and what little I do scares me.
I gotta tell you, Mr. Reuben, I'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. It's one thing to look after Jess...
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Yes. Goodbye.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Nah, man...
You three are gonna meet him for dinner. Find out if and where. Now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
I'm on the phone.
So's this.  Hey baby... Oh, nothing. What were you saying?
Can you check?
He's not here.
Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
What about it?
You said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to Max.
So, it was a draw.
I'll page you.
Ask if he said anything to her.
Maxie says he runs a tight ship. I wouldn't fuck with him.
C'mon, man, not in front of the baby. Put on your seat belt before I get another ticket.
She wants you to paint the ashtray.
Who's driving her?
I'll get the girl.
We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Maybe we should call for a cab.
You sure?
As a matter of fact I was. You got a problem with that?
They asked who it was.
Don't even start.
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
The what?
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
What do you have left?
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
This shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with Maxie.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
Don't fuck around. You're gonna get us all killed.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Hey. I'm half Lebanese.
How much is what?
You're up front. Everything's free up here.
Drinks are free, right?
Excuse me.
Just don't ask me no more shit.
Here...
Not usually. Mostly Trustafarians.
And where do we bring it?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
You can carry your keys. You will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. You will not speak to anyone while you are working. When you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. This means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. There is already a number in your pager's memory. It is a car service. When they ask you what account, you will respond: 'Cardiff Giant.' They will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. In other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. Do you see a pattern forming?
Yes, sir.
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
And where might that be?
Who's up for a night on the town.
He had it coming.
Keeps me out of the army.
When?
What?
Solid, daddy.
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
You owe me six big ones.
Now.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I thought you was smart. But you just another one of them cats strutting down the avenue in your clown suit with all that mess on you. Like a monkey. And the white man sees you and he laughs. He laughs because he knows you ain't white.
Elijah who?
That's what Mama used to say.
What for?
Man, how'm I gonna know the ones worth looking at?
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Lemme tell you about history: black history. You listening?
What?
At a gas station.  Will you marry me?
Just hold me.
I just want to sit here and be still.
The talk is everywhere!
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
We need you too!
Let's get out of this cold.
I wish you'd listen to us. What about the meeting tomorrow? We need to frisk people.
Let's cancel.
Is my family here yet?
As Jesus was. Jesus was also a Hebrew.
What color were the original Hebrews?
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
I do know I love you.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
Get out.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
What mission?
What does Sidney say?
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Let me die then.
C'mere.
You better believe it.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Yeah.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
What can you do?
He told you that?
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
This is your room, Malcolm. I know you'll keep it clean.
I'm not... easy.
Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been.
I'll call you tomorrow.
He's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. He's high on my hit list.
He lives in a Judicial Compound. He travels by motorcade. He has better protection than George Bush. Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad. His reach is far and wide.
I show, you give me the information?
[How do you contact 'the Boss'?]
[What is his name?]
[The what?]
[There was no ten million dollars.]
What do you mean, I'm here?
This is Mexico, they do everything backwards.
Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse.
You're crazy. People would hire a has-been, Ray? A drunk?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Creasy...
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
It wasn't a school like yours and there was no Sister Anna.
I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history.
Are you afraid of me?
You welcome the sound. The sound is what lets you go. The sound is what frees you. You are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
You don't drink like you used to.
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
If something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. I have skills in that respect. Pinta would benefit by the fact that... I'm a soldier.
Planned what?
Yeah? And if she was ugly?
For a few months. Hire someone cheap. You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. Then fire him for incompetence. The important thing is Lisa's daughter will return to school.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
This is Mr. Creasy.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there.
I wasn't thinking of Pinta.
[That's good. Really good. He shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. They're saying he's responsible.]
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
Two tourists who never went home.
You helped him get this job.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I told you she wasn't attractive...
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
What?
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
Down there. That little one there.
I been looking all over for you!
You want me to ride down with you?
Who told you that?
I feel fine.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
It's her baby too, you know.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
She gave me the evil eye.
When was this?
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Yes, I know.
Yes, I know.
Nothing.
Okay.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Are you kidding?
I'll see you.
About eight o'clock.
Sure, great if you ain't married.
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Tomatoes.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
You gonna die without a son.
So I'll die without a son.
I heard you, Ma.
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Hiya, Ralph...
Hey, Marty, come over here a minute.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Well...
...You hadda be the boss inna kitchen alla time!
I believe it takes both. I'd have to look it up.
Don't you know the first thing you're supposed to do at a new post is present yourself to the commanding officer with your orders?
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
That's right.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
No.  Or why you should.
He said it for us all, Walt.
I don't know what else. You've been that route a little, haven't you?
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
The door, Frank, the door! Where you from anyhow, Alaska?
He can't take much more time on the table.
So we got to cut him fast. I figure from the X-ray it ain't just the spleen. We also got to snatch his right kidney.
Nice guy, for an enamel surgeon.
Any time. Whenever we want.
Be right with you.
We're a good team.
I can't... couldn't.
Neither does Henry Blake. But I'll tell you what makes him the best C.O. you've got in any of your hospitals. He leaves all the medical decisions to the men who do the day- to-day work and understand what meatball surgery is.
I think I heard about that.
C-A-M-E-M...?
But weren't you supposed to meet the surgeons who are going to slice up the Congressman's son?
Beautiful. What do you think? Should we stop and play nine holes now and operate on the kid later? If he's still alive.
Just like we thought, it's a routine problem. Nurse, who's in charge of operating room preparations?
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
Oh, Jesus.
Sure, that's the right way... at John Hopkins or someplace. But how do we know there won't be even more of a jam-up a few days from now? Maybe we won't be able to get to him when we want to. Maybe the goddam thing'll erode the artery when nobody's looking. Our best shot is now.
Might make kind of a social issue, not having any other Negro officer.
Not necessarily.
That's right. We work well together.
I wonder how a degenerated person like you could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps.
There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you...
No trouble at all.  Hawkeye.
You're an attractive man.
You'd think now, with only six weeks before they ship me back home, it would be easier. But it isn't.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
Second pint.
You really say the cutest things.
Thanks.
Proud to know you, Trapper. Like to shake your hand if you'll hurry up and get that chest closed.  You still working the trains?
There's this native broad works in the laundry. I don't know if you've noticed.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
No, one thing I finally know for sure, I'll never function with a woman again.
Well, I'm sure my colleagues will agree there are a number of dependable measures for extinguishing the vital forces.
He's comin' this-a-way! The jaw- breaker!
I  wouldn't  wish  it  on  a  maneating  shark.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
They've all tried. Nobody's got to first base.
Yes, that's what I mean.
I did. First and only blow. So far.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
I used to throw the javelin.
What's that, Henry?
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right.
Um-hum.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it.
All set, Ann?
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
What?
What's that?
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do!
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
Now, that's crazy. It's fourteen floors!
I used to pitch.
Where is she?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Who are they?
Sure. Mostly often.
I know why you're hangin' aroundyou're stuck on a girlthat's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
A what?
A gag. A gag!
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goodsa fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
John Doe Club?
Sure.
They can't, huh?  Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
Huh? Get what?
No.
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside.
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
That's got nothing to do with it!
Yes! I was paid! But the
And what about the suicide note? You didn't write that, either!
Did you write itor didn't you?
Flowers.
What are you doing? Get Connell at the Bulletin !  Why, he's liable to go right past my window,  What was that?!
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street?
You can't help me, man.
Then where's my FUCKING car!
Am I gettin' the car?
That's right.
And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
I'm ready to do it.  And I'm going to be here more than two weeks.
Is there something wrong with that?
I don't really like to drink.
I don't gamble.
I think so.
No.
You're right. I'll never be as good a liar as you.
To run late!
We lost.
Maybe... There's one thing you have to remember... You don't create the situations. You can only try to save people from them.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.
I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.
You worship yourself.
Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
You got a bet on the game tonight?
I guess you realize that there's something special that I want to talk to you about.
And you think he'll...
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Scottie...
I mean I said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
First you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... No way.
You let us worry about that.
I'll provide you with transportation.
Roper...
It's all been transferred.
No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
Me?  Of course not.  That's why you're here.
Yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
It's his nature.
New York.
The woman you're stuck on.
Sorry, I just design the maze.  Keeping the keys secure is your job.
-- Yes.
What?
The Terrace.  First building Christoph ever programmed for us.
Why?
Good question.
Then how do you know about --
Realize?
Select uplink for Federal Communications Office.  Department of Enforcement.
... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power.
Ah... sure.
Everybody hold on tight.  We're gonna send this sucker into OBLIVION!
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin!
Ryan's Comet!!
WE'RE OUTTA HERE!
A real shame.
GO IVAN!!
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
Dulcea!  That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!!
GO POWER RANGERS!
Tell me about it.
But not you.
Life knocked me back.
No. Not everything.
He's hidin'. Word's out Tommy Reina's goin' over ta Maranzano.
You got men on Profaci's place?
Long as Charlie says.
Why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
I thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
Something came up.
You got something to hide?
Guess I'm too confused to think.
London?
Who'll make the rules?
So what is the problem?
The minute we sell out to Maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
How soon can we pull this off?
It's not myself I'm worried about.
It'll just be a few minutes.
They don't give a shit about us!
Boss, I got all the time you need.
You got no fuckin' choice. You might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
Lobster Fra Diavolo. Spaghetti with red clam sauce. Antipasto. And pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
Coming with me will be a delicate matter. We will work it out. But Charlie...
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
Thank you for keeping me informed.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
And what do you want out of this?
Hell. It's been four days!
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Guess I'm just lucky.
Because the world ain't big enough for the Dons. So we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. It ain't the way I'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I <u>enjoy</u> my job. Why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus" guy instead.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
Why?
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.
<u>Well</u>, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. Now would I?
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
Who?
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
<u>I'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Oh, <u>sure</u>. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
I just need to use the phone, lady.
No, I'm working too much, I don't have time.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
You know that guy in the pictures you saw?
Yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Yeah.  Not far.  You will be fine.  It's still day.
Forty-five all total.
It was?
I did not--
Blow a bugle!
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Would you settle for a husband?
What's this, Diz?
You got worms.
You know--little worms--ambition.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
Yes. Mostly "Puss."  Oh, the *other* prominent character in the play.
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words--*Willet Creek*. When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
Yeah. Funny--
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
I apologize.
Yeah.
Is the wind tired out there?
No--not offhand--
Come on--don't pull that. You know you'd give your right--. What are you staying away from him for?
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal!
What is it?
Sam Foley--dead!
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert!  Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Nonsense.
Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. I've got to see those angry committees first--feel them out a little--work for harmony--harmony.
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
Just get one hand against each ear there--keep his face straight up.
Is *what* getting me down?
Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
I beg your pardon?
The *Bills*? Jeff--let me advise you-- as your father would--politics is a business--sometimes a cruel business. In your time here, you couldn't even start on those Bills. They're put together by legal minds--after a long study. Why, after twenty years, I can't understand half of them myself. No, really, Jeff--in your own interests--
That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Goodnight, Miss Paine.
I have no defense against forged papers and--
He has imputed to me conduct unworthy a Senator--and I demand he be made to yield the floor--!
Jefferson--
Hello, Ma.  Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a while--
Just fine.
We'd better see.
No!
Did you say--bus?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
There *what* was?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
Gosh--that'll be something! You know what I better do in the morning?
Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss Saunders! Nothing better could have happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, we're going right ahead with it!
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I decided it was the one way in the world I could make myself--
Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should have been the one to think of it--
Right.
A *day*!
Why?
What's that?
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
We're over in the House.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
I did--and--and I got right up.
I want to make that come to life-- yes, and lighted up like that, too-- for every boy in the land. Boys forget what their country means--just reading "land of the free" in history books. And they get to be men--and forget even more. Liberty is too precious to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. Men ought to hold it up in front of them--every day of their lives and say: "I am free--to think--to speak. My ancestors couldn't. I can. My children will."
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
No complaints.
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
Lena.
In Terry Canyon?
Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* to take it up with him.  "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
Fine--they're fine.  Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize-- what the papers said I said about you--that wasn't true. I--I would never say a thing like that.
Splendid.
And how's your bill, Senator?
You were about to recognize me, sir--
If the Senator permits this motion to recess he will not have the floor in the morning to babble or anything else, unless he is recognized first by the Chair.
Oh--you're *sure* of that now?
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann-- 
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
Go away, Nosey.
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
What are you driving at? You want *me* to get him to sign that?
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
Jim--if what you say about the future is remotely possible--why not do as I say--drop things like this dam?
Well, what do you want me to do? Stand around like you chump and let that drooling infant wrap that Willet Creek Dam appropriation around my neck. Either he falls in line with us and behaves himself or I'll break him so wide open they'll never be able to find the pieces.
You won't stand for it?
I don't want any part of crucifying this boy.
But--if he *does*, Joe--
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
Thank you very much.
No! I resigned last week!
Yes!!!
What?
What did they say?
Huh?  Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
He did? I play the tuba
Yeah, I know.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
I'd like to read it some time.
Thank you.
Let's just walk, okay?
I don't blame you.
A girl?
No. It's nothing.
Don't be ridiculous.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
Perfect! Perfect!
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
Where?
All set.
How do you do.
Yes.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
What for?
No?
Yes. That is to say
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Nah.
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
Okay, you're the boss.  When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
Arthur wants to quit!
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings.
Why, it's an artistic institution
We own an opera house, don't we?
Naturally.
Because it just isn't a business, that's all!
No, I mean - about my client.
One-third? That's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
Mr. Morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
Over at that big round table. The one that looks like a poodle.
He's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
Farmer?
What's that?
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
You have no pants, sir.
Me, sir?
How did they threaten you?
Take your time.
Mr. Cook.
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
No, not really.
What's that?
Why not?
Good, then go.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
You are so mean.
But you did come to me.
Me too, Doc. And I can't tell you what that package meant to me --
Doc. Nice to meet you.
What do you do?
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry.
What?
I think it's like... inquisitive.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Why do you watch?
You're on your own today, honey.
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea?
Why don't you tell me?
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Disgusting.
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
Either one.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I thought only action movies had villains like that.
Of course.
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
Weekly or monthly?
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
Was it something that happened at school?
I understand.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Just you.
You were messed up, man.
Things got a lot worse.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do.  Mainly, I listen.
Doc, there's something about what you told me the other night I can't get out of my head. It's driving me batty --  Why me? How did you know you could trust me?
Lots of institutions. My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall. Had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
This is Prince Imhotep, High Priest of Osiris.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
Forget the bumbling Americans, they will be like all the others. Without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find Hamunaptra?
Correct, And that's when --
If we want to kill the creature, yes.
The only thing that scares me, Mister O'Connell, are your manners.
I know my treasure.
Not unless you call me Rick.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
No, we are not.
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
The creature!? Are you sure!?
I think you were jealous
Drunkard? Fool? Rat-bastard? Please call me something original.
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
Yes, awfully tempting, wasn't it?
Um-hmm.
When was that?
But you're a superhero.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
Me, too.
It's me... Elizabeth.
And the nuts always call themselves great.
Then why are you here?
Roy.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
I just want to be a superhero.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
I lost another fork tonight. She's getting suspicious, I know it.
Roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Normal. What's normal? Does normal exist? And if it did, how would we know it?
Hey... he's gone.
We're superheroes.
Wow.
I use it... to fight evil.
How long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
The Disco Boys.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
But, Your Majesty, the very substance of the Tilsit treaty was that you should join the Continental Blockade, boycott English goods, suspend all commercial dealings with her, and be France's ally.  Nothing more is being asked than to comply with the treaty.
Very well, General, what is it you wish to say?
Ah, yes -- proceed.
Your Majesty has grasped the outlines of his problem in much less time than it took me.  This is a crucial point -- and it is a political one, which Your Majesty will be in a far better position to answer than I.  Can Napoleon afford to abandon Moscow without signing even the preliminaries of a peace treaty with you?
I am at your disposal, Your Majesty.
May I come to the map?
Any cannon?
In every practical sense, yes, but, officially, of course, I would have to retain command.
Our lives, the revolution, my career?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
Yes, sire?
Yes, sir.  I hope you will excuse me for asking, General Bonaparte, but are you Corsican?
Ajaccio.
Have you been back recently?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
Why didn't you wake me then?
We have already captured a dozen incendiaries, convicts, released just two days ago.  They said they were acting under orders of the secret police.
My God -- this could be very bad for us... very bad, indeed.
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
But, my dear Duroc, how can I act without guidance from Vienna?  I haven't the slightest idea of how the Emperor Francis might feel about this.
Oh...?
My dear Francis, you do seem extremely uncomfortable.
Yes, it is.  It must be one of the worst nights we have had this winter.
One must take life as it comes -- do you live in Lyon, sir?
No...
I know of no better time.
Well, you shall see.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
I rarely see him, Your Highness, but I believe he is in excellent health, and he is very happy with the child.
Ah, well, my dear Madame de Montesquiou, peace of mind can eventually be a substitute for happiness.
Thank you, Madame de Beauharnais. You probably don't recall but we met briefly a few months ago, at a party at Paul's house.
Yes, we introduced ourselves at the door.
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
You are very kind, Madame de Beauharnais.  Do you have some sherry, perhaps?
Well, I'm sure that you will be just as pleased to have this as he will be.
I thought I was.  I was confused.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Yes!!
I know that I shouldn't butt into things... that are really no concern of mine... but you shouldn't write a letter like that to Joseph.
There are some things... better left unsaid.
Yes.
My God, what do you think?
I know.
Yes?
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Papa said only to comply with any request you might make of me.
That is a matter of opinion.
Is he alone?
Life is a burden for me.  Nothing gives me any pleasure; I find only sadness in everything around me.  It is very difficult because the ways of those with whom I live, and probably always shall live, are as different from mine as moonlight is from sunlight.
It will scarcely be considered credible, perhaps, but our whole business consisted in eating cherries together.
Yo' cousin, Craig.  Hook us up.
Go, fo' I change my mind.
Uncle Elroy, who's that girl by Day-Day's car?
Suga!
Yes you did.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Oh, yeah, where you work at?
Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
Out the door and to the left.
How you know?  It could be anything.
The bubble guts.  I'm so nervous it feels like I'mma shit on myself.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Wait for what?
No, man, just wait.
Naw, I'm got live ghetto fabulous.  make sure you get that car fixed.
Hell yeah, I remember you.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
Better sooner than later.
It's locked.
It's alright.
No, I'mma go on to work.  I don't wanna hear Elroy's mouth.  Now listen to me, Craig.  It's gonna be different living over here.  Don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  Understand?
I feel you.  I've just been practicing that one move all week.  I thought that was it.
Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
Sorry, dude.
R-U-S-H Intensely.
This is a knock.
Thanks for the help.
Rancho Cucamonga?
What?
'Take your car?'
Don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  He in the best fuckin' hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby!  This my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  Ain't that right, nephew?
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
I slip my disc, again... Oh got damn.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
What's he doing here?
Who, him? Just visiting.
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
You sent my assistant on an errand.
I've been a bad boy.
What?
Oh, yeah?
I appreciate that.
That's...a comfort to hear.
What?
Yes.
Yes. It's OK, Lynn. These are our friends.
I will do no such thing.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
Then I have time for a drink.
That's not my problem, Mr. Watson
That's right. That gives you...
You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
On TV.
You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that?
He's doing it for you. No matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
All right. Kisses to you.
Keep it.
Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off.
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Oh, Jesus ...
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Yeah, now listen.  I can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. You go down get yourself something to drink. Make sure Godzilla there, follows you.
It goes in that little hole.
My daddy is going to be a hero? Like Power Rangers?
Yeah.
What do you figure he done with it?
Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
I come not with Peace but with a Sword.
Well goodnight, boy. Come again -- any time.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
About what!
Sshhh! He's in there.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
John don't like him much.
The money, Icey.
Oh, Icey, I'm a sight!
The pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
She tarried around the kitchen after I'd gone up, and when I went downstairs to see what was wrong...
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
John! Don't!
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
I don't know nothin'!
The summer is young yet, little lad.  Pearl?
Don't you believe me?
Naturally.
Yes. But first of all we'll have a little talk.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
There's two new ones over at your place, ain't there Ruby?
Pearl and John.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
I -- no, I --
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
Right funny, hain't it, how they rowed all the way up river in a ten- foot john-boat!
What are you after them for?
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
What?
The man! The man!
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
Just checking -- keep out of sight!
I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura.
Who?
Just want to talk to him a second.
You know he's dead though, right?
Something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
Krueger.
Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room!  Sorry. Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
It wasn't that serious...
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
To bed with you, c'mon.
Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
I do want to know. He's not dead and gone -- he's after me and if I sleep he'll get me! I've got to know!
No more fights.
Have you any money?
Good evening, Ninotchka.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
Just for the honeymoon.
Positively not!
That's right.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
Why should you be afraid?
You didn't get legal advice?
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
I must be stern with you.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
We have opened a restaurant...
The Duchess...
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Good evening, Monsieur.
Yes, General Savitzky?
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I just said let's have a little lunch.  Room service.
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
I think she covered you with the parasites.
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
We did our best, Comrade.
Well, we're back home.
Even the swallows are back.
She has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Private.
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
But you had!
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
No visa.
You're going to force us... huh?
On what?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Suppress it.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Yes.
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
Thank you. Thank you.
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
That is correct.
I was wounded before Warsaw.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
What?
On which boat?
I have never heard one.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
I don't think so.
Ninotchka, I love you.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
A funny story?
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Our salute will be a kiss.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
Those newspaper people?
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Oh, Leon!
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Oh, yes.
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
No.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
Months, Swana.
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
Hello.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
We have nothing to discuss.
Where are they?
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
What do you want?
That depends on the tip.
Yes, it does.
Yes.
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur.  This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every café and night club. Here...  "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
My jewels?!
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
He told me to take you to his conference room.
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
Mitchell's out of his mind now. Martha just put her head through a plate-glass window.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
This is not a joke, John!
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
And what am I supposed to do?  Just sit here and watch them coming closer? Eating their way to the center?  Lyndon bugged!  So did Kennedy!  FDR cut a deal with Lucky Luciano. Christ, even Ike had a mistress! What's so special about me?  What about Lyndon?  He could make a couple of calls to the Hill and shut this whole thing down.  Did anyone talk to him?
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
'Night, Al.
But he works for the Attorney General. Only Richardson can fire him.
The hell he will!  Fire him, too.  If you have to go all the way down to the janitor at the Justice Department, fire the sonofabitch!  And ...
It was right after the Pentagon Papers broke.  They went in to get his psychiatric records.
"Security" is not strong enough.
Just do what I say, Bob.
Yes, sir.  I'll talk to Helms, and, uh ... what's our press position on this Watergate thing?  What do I tell Ziegler to tell them?
Jesus!
And not just Hunt.  Frank Sturgis, all those Cubans.  All of them in the Watergate.  They were involved in Track 2 in Cuba.  Hunt reported to my military aide. But I met with him several times as Vice President.  That's what worries the shit out of me.  I don't know how much Hunt knows.  Or the Cubans.
Because ... because Dick Helms knows too much ... If anyone in this country knows more than I do, it's Hoover and Helms!  You don't fuck with Dick Helms!  Period.
They had us bugged.  Christ, he had everybody bugged.  Yeah, he was gonna support me in '68, but he was also threatening me.  That was Hoover: he'd give you the carrot, but he'd make damn sure the stick went right up your ass.
There's a poison in the upper classes, Bob.  They've had it too soft.  Too many cars, too many color TVs ...
Sir?
... "The Beast."  A nineteen-year-old kid.  She understands the nature of "the Beast."  She called it a wild animal.
Let him finish, Bob.
Then this shall be our little secret.  Remember that I see into thy soul as God sees.  Thou may fool the world. Even thy father.  But not me, Richard. Never me.
Is it my turn?
I'm not Jack Kennedy.  Your agency is secure.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
But ... if we were able to separate China from Russia once and for all, we can -- we could create a balance of power that would secure the peace into the next century.
No.
Kennedy -- never.  He'll fry in hell for what he did to me.  But Nixon doesn't know that, which is why I'm gonna have to remind him he needs us a helluva lot more'n we need him.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
I mean I got federal price controls on my oil.  The ragheads are beating the shit out of me.  And I got your EPA environment agency with its thumb so far up my ass it's scratching my ear.
I ... I heard something ... It sounded idiotic.
You have many friends ... and admirers ...
Fung pi!   I've only managed to change a few things around the city of Beijing.  I want to know your secret.
Yes, Mr. President.
Looks can be deceiving ...
The real war is in us.  History is a symptom of our disease.
... Any information you have, Edgar. The sonofabitch is not gonna steal from me again!  Can you back me up on this?  Can I count on your support?
Hello ...
It sounds like you're talking about a wild animal.
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
Sir?
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
You're not a failure, Dick.
Is that the truth?
Can I just ask for one thing?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling.  But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
Thank you.
Don't be ridiculous!
No ... it's just going to start now ...  If I could just ... If I could just ... sleep.
Never made so much money in my life. But my upbringing doesn't allow me to enjoy it.  I did get to argue a case before the Supreme Court.
Lost.
Whatcha mean by that?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down.
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
I don't know. Sometimes I think he's pretty much a ghost.
That don't hardly say it. He shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
No I ain't.
I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is.
Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
It could be.
The old boy shot by the highway?
That's the boy.
It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff?
Wasn't no bullet.
Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
We dedicate ourselves daily anew. Something like that.
What do you think.
Well I didn't see it.
I ain't got the money.
No.
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself.
It's full a money.
Yeah.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' where?
Llewelyn --
Yes I do.
Yes ma'am?
Why would I let you do that?
In the truck.  I'll get it.
Huh? Airport or airstrip?
I think that you do. Do you know where I'm going?
Yeah? Where am I?
That's foolish. You pick the one right tool.
With what?
You already asked me that.
See about closing.
Yessir.
Well...
You live in that house behind the store?
Yes.
All right. Heads then.
Sir?
Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles.
Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it.
Okay.
Well enough.
You want to change rooms?
It's called a transponder.
Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
I don't know.
No sir.
Yes sir.
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette...  It's no big deal, Betty.
...plenty
No, Elden, I need to...
It wasn't a woman.
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday.  That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
That's a nice name for what you need...
Any idea where it is?
I know plenty.
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
No, I was just... How you doing?
Oh. How come?
...I... I know what you are.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I better go check on them.
Really? You've just described all of Southern California.
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
You're late, Eric.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Yes... maybe it was.
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
It's not really a good time, guys...
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
So why'd you come to L.A.?
The one you were telling me about?
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
You should have a little faith in people.
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
Deranged. That would be the right word.
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Fine. You got five...
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
That's what I thought.  You better give me another example.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
We don't know which Buick, do we?
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
I hope you're right...
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain.  They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
I know that.
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
We know that...
Can I have an evil twin?
I'll think about it.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
No, about... Are you talking about Duane Cooley?
Did Chloe crack?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
- but now it deposits you here.
You can't do this - we just been pardoned!  By the Governer himself!
All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust!
What about you, Everett? What'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place?
Huh?!
Fire! I hate fire!
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
Well that's right! If then! Believe me, Delmar, Woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days a man!
Oh-ho-ho yes, I've spread my seed. And you see what it, uh... what it's earned me... Now what in the...
He was never turned into a frog!
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Well now Pappy I wouldn't put it that strong...
Well, that's how I characterize it.
Aw, honey, our ring is just a old pewter thing -
But I don't mind telling you, I'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end...
I said I thought it was in the rolltop desk.
Or in my chiffonier. I don't know.
Uh-huh.
Yes, but honey -
That wasn't my doing...
Well, Pete, I just figured it should be the one with capacity for abstract thought. But if that ain't the consensus view, hell, let's put her to a vote!
Well I'm votin' for yours truly too!
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
You didn't know that at the time!
I cain't help it, but that's a wonderful thing to say!
But... but...
I couldn't wait two weeks! She's gettin' married tomorra!
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Wait a minute - who elected you leader a this outfit? Since we been followin' your lead we got nothin' but trouble! I gotten this close to bein' strung up, n'consumed in a fire, 'n whipped no end, 'n sunstroked, 'n soggied -
Well that record has just gone through the goddamn roof! They're playin' it as far away as Mobile! The whole damn state's goin' ape!
Buyin' nipples!
Yes, Sir.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
What for?
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
Who?  Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
The whole world's a jungle, huh, Mayo? Dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly jets, sir!
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
He was. He died.
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Then, I'll see you around.
Sid, there's no baby.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
You hope.
Do you go to school?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Forget it. Just get out of here.
I'm starving.
I'll get it if you want.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Does it still hurt?
Are those for me?
I know that.
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own.  I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
Peace out.
God.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
The fuck did you do that for?!
Who's the clown now?  Huh?!  Who's the fucking clown now?!
Remember that.
Please...
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
Get the fuck away from me.
NOT THAT ONE?!
They're not supposed to be here!
Exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
She'll call the cops, they'll be here before I get unpacked.
Do me a favor and don't talk.
Huh?
It's okay, Raoul.
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
I don't know.  Rob us.  I don't know.
Yeah.
"Get the fuck out of my house."
To prove he wasn't chicken.
Not in the bedroom.  Do it!
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
I tell you "officer", it wasn't...
You know it brother.
Sure, those boojie jokers don't do anything except print up a lotta paper saying "Black is Beautiful."
Brimmer! Could you come in here please?
Just hold on a god damn minute. I...
Yeah, it's me.
Judge, hold on, is your phone safe?
Yeah... I'm fucked up. You're fucked up. Government's fucked up. Whole country's fucked up. You got no idea what's going on here. This is bigger than you and me. We're just little tiny soldiers getting moved around on some big asshole's desk. The Panthers... fuck you're history... they killed you and you don't even know it.
Inside ain't in the system.  It's right there inside you!! I'm joining up.
PE? What? You guys doing gym class?
Not yet, one of these day's maybe. Bobby's party chairman. Political Education's really his bag.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Naw... I gotta...
Naw... They're kids mostly. Idealists. They actually think they're for real.
Yeah... then shouldn't this be all of us together.
Well... like they say, there's a Panther born every minute in the ghetto. Uh... we seem to have "underestimated" the support of the Black community. It's their power base...
No you wait a second. You and your "Panthers" got three choices. One you join with us and follow our rules. Two you change your name.  Or three you face annihilation.
Yeah.
Okay man I ain't going to push. But remember the revolution isn't going to wait for anyone. Come on, we'll give you a lift.
Chickenshits, they're grabbing at anything.
Like the manual says, "Information is...
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
If you got something to say, say it.
Anything happens to Huey it ain't gonna be a finger. I'll...
What are you saying?
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
No... wait, there's something else, something weird. I hear he's set up down at that warehouse on fifty deuce. He's talking big and living bigger.
Lord, never thought I'd live to see my boy in prison.
You believe that?
Congratulations.
Uh... uh... I...
I expect to try.
Trust you and Harry Lee.  Remember that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis?
My pleasure, sir.
What officers?
Most certainly.  Arrange it.
Unless I'm dreaming, I think I see irregulars at their center.
The middle colonies?
I have no choice, I...
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
I've been doing this for two years. I'm the best scout in the Continental Army, the best horseman, the best shot, the best scavenger and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston.
Flanking riders?
Full sentences.  As if she had been speaking all along.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Come with me.  I'll tell you when we get there.
Is it her?  Is Anne in there?
That's not enough.  Tell me.
I was an American, I just didn't know it yet...
I'm a parent, I don't have the luxury of principles.
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
Thank you.
Four, five miles.
But what about Thomas?
Bite?
Yes--
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
Yaay!
Well, I thought it was safe--
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Not at all.
Good for you.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
Then come on.
Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
I guess so...but...
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Your cairn.
Wouldn't wash?
Yes.
Well...a touch of the flu...
This babe has said enough.
Shit! Look at this mess!
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
Leave me alone!
Don't talk like an asshole even if you are just a bit of underdone potato or a blot of mustard.
Good d--
You're doing fine.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
Aye, aye, sir!
She.  Goes.  Free.
Elizabeth goes free!
And Jack.  And the crew.  Free and unharmed.  If you agree ... then ... I will remain with you.
You're playing this as close to the edge as any man, I'll give you that.  We might just have to sign articles, you and I.  Jack, you're a pirate at heart, that's certain.
That fool woman took it.  You be careful around her, Jack -- she's pretty enough, she'll steal your heart -- but pure evil inside.
The last time you do this, you left me a pistol, with one shot.
That so?
Because it's what you're searching for.  You've been searching for it for years.  I recognize this ship. I saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England.
It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
Would that I could.
Aye.  And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded.  But it will drive us no longer.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Boy overboard!
You're speaking up for him again?
Your father is frantic with worry. Our mission was to rescue you and return home.  That is what we shall do.  Mr. Turner's fate is regrettable.  But so was his decision to engage in piracy.
I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London.
He said you say that!  He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked.
Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?
Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant tale, best left untold.
What?  He never told me that.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
Ah.  Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record.  So if you'll excuse me ...
Move!
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Because you're a pirate.
He was a merchant marine!  He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules--
I'm sure.  When you've led the kind of life that I have, there are debts that must be paid.  Maybe I can balance the scales a little.
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
Where did he come from?
To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O'Brien, I don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that.
You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched.  Poppy?
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
That remains to be seen.
Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to keep the meltdown under control.
You don't want this.
So what?  So what?  For starters, how about littering is a crime.
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
Aaabout...?
This morning.  I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Who isn't?
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
Really?  What have you been doing?
The big house?
We'll see how wonderful it is after you spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.
The waste.
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Do you have something to bring me down?
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
It's still inside me?
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
God, what a fight that was.
I'm real touched.  Now get your Sunday's on.  We're going for a ride.
Oh yes you are!
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
And you have him?
We lost him.
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Yes, he might be.
I don't mind her if you don't.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Oh yes you will wear garters
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
You're acting like a child.
It was a miracle. The man was ill or something.
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
Well, I should say!
Give my regards to your managing editor.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Come on, get going, get going!
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see'  Tweet, tweet - ha, ha
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Of course I haven't got a nose.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
How is her family going to feel about it?
There you are!
Hello, Stew.
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Right.
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Huh?  Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
I have it here.
You quit trying to stop anybody
I don't eat waffles.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
I sort of invited him along to bend an elbow. You don't mind, do you?
Hello, Joe.
"Cinderella Man Grows Hair On Chest!"
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
Yes - the worm!
I beg your pardon?
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
Heavens! The man's insane!
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
Yes sir.
Yeah?
Sure.
Yeah ...  That--and ...
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
Well ...  Here's what it's s'posed to look like.
Bud brought it to me.
But you can't go out there.
Yeah. It does.
I was in a bowling-alley.
I mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but I figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. Don't you?
Trust me ...
Oh, no thanks ...
Real rain?
The one in your mind. The one that you see on a bright cold morning. The one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
No way.
Owns the hardware store.
Play along?
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
To who?
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
Nothing.
... Yeah.
No. She really liked you.
What?
What?
Right here.
And you're sure about this?
Hunh?
We'll get you fixed up in no time.
Right. And how did she dress him?
... Like Prince Charming.
That's right.
Talk about it. Right now, I mean. I got to ... um ...
Terrific. I'll talk to you then.
Because you're coming home.
I'm so glad you're here.
Listen to me!
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Really?
Hi.
TV repair?
Yeah ...
Hey it's me, what are you doing?
"chat?" Did you just say "chat?"
I think that's a type-o then, that would be a mistake.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
Please don't.
Yeah I can't.
I'm sorry.
It's fine, but --
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
Nothing.
Are your pants off?
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
What do you mean, "really?" Yeah. Really. What about you?
No.
Georgia.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
Really? Please?
This is not cool.
I have to go.
Hi.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
Are you guys hurt?
-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
Ok.
Ok.
About six months.
Yeah.
So that was your pudding?
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
What?
...yeah...
If you come to Hawaii --
You don't think you'll go --
I don't know.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
That's right you travel so much.
Yeah.
Let's go to the hospital.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
Did you have my home phone number?
For what?
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
No.
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
Why?
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
337.....I'm sorry....
It's ok, take your time.
Maybe you said that because you're hungry.....
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
Yeah.
Fine, thank you.
It takes that much time to process the order and make sure it's valid --
So what should I do with the pudding?
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
....I made a call.....  ....and, uh....
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
How much money do you have in your pockets?
Is this where you live?
No.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
Ok.
Seriously.
I won't.
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
Ok.
So...did my brother call you?
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
Then what's he doing here?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
THEN BUGGER ME!
His rug.
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
I saw the longing in your eye --
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Who's to say I did not?
NEVER!
Of course.
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
Yes?
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delbenè; I look to the future.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
I'll pass the word on, then.
Maybe someday you'll tell me your name.
Oh, it's terrible! It's too, too terrible!  Well. Go on.
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
I don't believe it!
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
You're just scared.
Sure you can, just--
And he did.
Sure
Apparently it details the exploits of a publisher like myself. Entirely too much like myself. Do you follow so far?
Yes.
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
You needn't use that language with me
"You talk about the people as if you owned them. As though they belonged to you. As long as I can remember, you've talked about--"  Orson, I am so goddamn tired--
I can't remember the lines!
Huh?
We're using-
Good God no! The character is a delicious amalgamation of various press barons--
No -- no -- I mean--
Louella, please, be reasonable, I understand you have problems with Orson's picture but maybe we can work something out--
And Mr. Hearst has authorized me to tell you that you're looking at the most beautiful lawsuit in history if you release this picture. He'll bleed your little studio dry and you can all go on back to New York and do Shakespeare with the Boy Wonder.
You are talking to him.
But you keep coming up with the same elitist crap - - HEART OF DARKNESS with a million dollar budget?! - - no one wants to see that.
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
But with compassion and insight--
Image a man that has shaped his time. A titanic figure of limitless influence. Think about empire. A man with an empire at his feet. A man, like a baron, living in a palace, a glorious palace on a hill, and controlling the permutations of everyone beneath him. Feudal.
How long have we spent casting our minds about the world when the answer to our prayers was right here under our noses -- every single day in the newspapers and on the radio -- waiting for us in that ridiculous castle! Waiting for--!
--Because he has been so furiously busy wasting himself. Amusing his keepers. Because he is a sycophant! Because he has been thrown out of every studio in Hollywood and no one will hire him because he's a drunk- -!
She was . . . innocent
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
YOU CAN'T DO THIS TOME -- THIS WAS OUR STORY, REMEMBER? -- YOU AND ME AND GODDAMN EVERYONE ELSE - - REMEMBER THAT?!
No, you gotta hear this-
Jews. She's talking about Jews.
What does this have to do with--?
Kinda.
This ain't George's doing--!
Yeah, you're probably right.
Surely My pleasure, Miss Davies..
Very generous
Yes
You talked to Mr. Swanbeck?
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
Listen, get off your horse with me. You know I've stuck by you since the beginning of time it seems like, while the stockholders in New York were ready to cut and run and everyone else in Hollywood was set to toss me in a rubber room. But your contract stipulates a max budget of 500 thousand. This one's gonna come in at 750 thousand. What do we do about that?
For Christ's sake, shut up--
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
Who the fuck are you trying to kid? You are that soulless monster.
Look, not a single scene shot in the studio! We've found natural locations for the whole story--
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
I need my shoes in total focus right here and also Joe back there--!
Yes!
I'm Christ
Do you think I'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
You know?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Jack, I got no gloves.
See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
Yeah, I know.
C'mon, Joey.
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
Where you been?
When?
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
What bullshit? Hey, I'm your brother. You wanna believe me -- you trust me?
What do you mean, "you"?
Whatsa matter with you?
Well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in New York. And they're saying that you don't cooperate.
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
You sound bitter.
Yeah. At night.
Ya hear, Joey? She thinks this face is cute? Hey, whatcha doin' now? You wanna go for a ride?
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Can you see it?
Come over here.
You said never to touch you before a fight.
What?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
I called. You weren't there.
What'd you see?
I am answering...
Do I have to kill you, eh?  Do I have to kill somebody to get an answer?  I know about you at the Copa. I know all about it.
You did?
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me.  Kill me.  I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
Jake --
Why don't you just call him up?
What do I say to him? Call him up on the phone and say, "Joey, I'm sorry about that little trouble we had. How about havin' dinner?" Is that what I say?
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
He should.
Excuse me for living.
No, you're his wife.
It don't look right.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
Goodnight.
This could go off in a month -- or an hour.
Name me a better photographer.
Don't worry -- it comes off today.
Thanks.
I was jaywalking.
Jeff -- huh?
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
Your Lisa?
For getting rid of that cast.
Wrong day?
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
I don't know what you mean.
No.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
Huh?
And digging in.  Look at that flower bed.
First offense burglary --  -- probably two-fifty.  The piggy bank.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Only because it's expected of her.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
You mean leave the magazine?
Yes.
That's what I'm afraid of.  Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard? 
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
You mean "goodnight."
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
Nothing, thank heaven.
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
Don't you see how silly you're being?
What's the apartment house number?
I never saw him ask her for advise before.  But she volunteered plenty.
Thinking about Thorwald?
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
What doesn't?
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
L. B. Jefferies.
Friend of yours?
Somebody find him a knife.
Stay there.
Buzz Gundersen.
How'd he get in?
Any other entrance?
Nothing, Crunch.  They picked him up like the rest of--
You clean out of your head?  Come on!
No.
Then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
Yes.
We'll make time.  Where's some paper.  We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
I just want to show you how foolish you are.  When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
Sorry.
Have some cigars.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Open it.
Where's your mother tonight, Plato?
I don't know.  End up in the electric chair?
Head-shrinker?
I don't want to make friends.
No.  It's okay.
They think you told the police on them.  They--who's in there?
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
You remember that far back?  Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat!  You got a match?  I'm going to break my neck in here.  Where are you?
What do you think?
My gun?
Come on!
Just a guard.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Goodbye, dear.
Mom--I'm not--
But I am involved!  We're all involved, Mom!  A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
Big tough character.  You don't kid me, pal.  How come you're not wearing your boots?
All the time!  I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up.  I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
Chicken?
You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Cut it out now.  I'm warning you.
Dig the square wardrobe!
I'm not so bad.
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
You don't need to do that.
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
What a relief!
Talk to them!  Heavens!
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
That one?
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
What?
Gabriel -- !
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
Searching for a money man...
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
You are to me.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Yeah. Me too.  Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
Security, Ash, I just worked security. They wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
I'll see what I can do.
Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain.  I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
He working for them on this one?
They're truck drivers.
I don't know...
I'm glad it was me.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
I never told you my name.
No, you can't --
You what...
But you were saying you were...
Wish I had a brother like you.
What'd they call her in college?
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
Christmas... Eve...
This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
Trust me. They won't recognize me.
Nnn... nothing...
NO!
I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
You need six.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
And where they hide the real money.
Monster. There never was a structure change. This place was built the same from day one.
OPEN IT!!!
We're aware of your position.
Mr. Bangs.
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
Acid-chewer.
His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do.
Yeah.
Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Good for you. Protein.
You're GONNA be there! We're getting outta here! TAKE IT!
...for Christmas...
NICK!!!
Do what?
Funny you should mention it. That's what your father and I been talkin' about.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin' like a nigger. It's all that black semen been shootin' up his butt. It's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.
No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Me and you'll drive down to Long Beach tomorrow. I'll introduce you to Matthews, tell him what's going on.
Daddy, I got an idea. Now just hear it out. I know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, Vic ain't one of the boys. He's been gone for four years. He ain't on no one's list. Ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.
I don't know, but somebody did.
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
Who, Mr. White?
A little.
The Milwaukee Brewers?
He's a cool guy. A real nice, real funny, real cool guy.
How is he?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
Jesus Christ, Joe. Fuckin' forget it. This is beneath me. I'm Mr. Pink, let's move on.
You don't need proof when you got instinct. I ignored it before, but not no more.
He don't tip?  You don't tip? Why?
Nope.
Fuck 'em, they set off the alarm, they deserve what they got.
When I was coming down here, I was playin' it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million-trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
I'm telling ya, it wasn't that soon. They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr. Blonde went off. I'm not sayin' they weren't there, I'm sayin' they were there. But they didn't move in till Mr. Blonde became a madman. That's how I know we were set up. You can see that, can't you, Mr. White?
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Of course.
Enough! You better start talkin' to us, asshole, cause we got shit we need to talk about. We're already freaked out, we need you actin freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
We're going to look for him. Want to come along?
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
They're stragglin'.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
Thanks.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
I'll make the soap myself.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
Maybe it's better that way.
You don't mean that Clay.
I haven't got the job yet.
A little hot.
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Good thing you didn't.
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
You better start.
Kind of sore.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
Nobody asked you to.
I said I didn't care.
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
I don't like to see you go.
That's it then.
One night more won't matter. Your friend'll be there. Anyway I don't think so much of the idea of prowling around his ranch. He knows you're out so he ain't going to sit still for it.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
What do they look like?
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
But you're his brother.
It's a long ways yet.  I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
That's always tough. How long were you together?
No, I haven't dated in a while. My last boyfriend's...
In room "302" at ten o'clock?
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Psychology.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Hey, I have an idea...
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
It looks like the furnace.
Hugh Kane.
Well, I was hoping to get my balls licked.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
Well... okay... but only as a friend.
There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
Hot dogs.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
It's the sequel.
Right behind you.
No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
Just wait, you'll see.
No, my friends are right here!
I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Oh.
Even in the bathroom?
Ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they'd wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
What is it? Some tits? A beaver shot? What?
I supposed you'd like a leg. How about two?
Alright, go to the belt store...
Yes.
My holy water.
Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
Always the dentist.
I certainly did not.
No "but mom" for you, young man. Mr. Stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies. 
But, Chip...
Hold on...  Yeah I am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
Misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  Detectives, it's time for you to leave. My wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
Officers, I've never said the P-word out loud, much less written it down!
You're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Well, honey, chickadees breed in Alaska, you know. No wonder Dede's hungry. It's a long trip all the way to Baltimore.
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Yes, I did.
GODDAMN YOU! THAT'S TRESPASSING!
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
One beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
It's sugarless.
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
If you wouldn't mind...  It was on sale.
...Browsing.
No...  I don't have room in my kitchen...
He's a good boy.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
You forgot something...
Eight dollars?! Franklin Mint or not, it's damaged goods! 
Sure I do.
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
I don't know if I want to go with you or not.
Which room is it?
Thank you.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
She can only use cash.
For the time being, I imagine that must do.
"The Dante?"
Redi's all right.
She's a pretty good sort.
Nothing.
Nothing! That's absurd. I heard you laughing and talking, She was asking questions.
And that was all?
I won't do it again. We're friends. I'll never order you about again.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table  the one at the feet of Dante.
It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police  stand trial  I don't think he knows.
Verse -- verse that I wrote. I need it.
Good-bye.
I thought it would be, but just to be sure, I'll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers --
But it's a small room, Jason.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the wine.
What a peculiar question.
Because there was another girl years ago -- a nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once - I saw her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That's why.
Actually I want to ask two favors of you -- one as a poet 	one as a detective.
Tell me what?
Yes. You know the devil and all his minions are marked that way.
I don't know.
It seems right to us.
I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I have only curiosity -- a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most of you are!
And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today -- to bring him this rejected manuscript -will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
What?
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
Graham Dalton.
False alarm.
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
You play an instrument?
No, I was in charge of kind of standing at the microphone and reciting these really depressing lyrics in a monotone. The whole thing was really... irrelevant. How do you like being married?
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Well... well, the cliché about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Sister older or younger?
How do you mean?
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
Kids? What about them?
You are?
Well, let me put it this way: I cannot achieve an erection while in the presence of another person. So, for all practical purposes, I am impotent.
So you don't believe in therapy?
That's correct.  Bit of a dilemma, isn't it?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
What kind of personal project?
Oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. Mine's just a little more personal.
Yes.
It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
It won't. Are you ready?
Ann Bishop Millaney.
When we're making love?
Then as far as this taping goes, you have nothing to worry about.
I thought I made that clear before, when I said I would go down on you.
Why not?
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Subtlety?
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
I couldn't face her if I had slept with somebody else.
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
I'm okay. It's okay.
Stay away from the Garden District. Serious crime. I don't know what kind of place you're looking for, but there are a lot of studio-type apartments available elsewhere.
Are you having an affair?
You've made your point.
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
I take it you've never masturbated?
Did you confront John about the visitor?
The friend of John's that was staying at your house.
I thought that's what I did. Who was it that you talked to?
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
Well, I wonder why.
But he won't.
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
I just thought it might --
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
Because I never got around to it.
Well, why?
No, it's nothing like that.
I don't know.
Why did you do that?
You don't know that for sure.
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
I feel like I do.
It looks like a tablecloth.
Hold on.
Well. I can't stay.
Did you take your clothes off?
Nope.
How did you find me?
About what?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Yes.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
Then what happened?
I would.
Right.
I hate the thought of guys hitting on you all the time.
Who said I was jealous?
Could be risky.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Nothing wrong with trying.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
I wish you hadn't done that.
By definition you're lying to Ann, too.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
A bonfire, probably.
Or go someplace in a hurry.
You know which tapes! Where are they?
So is my wife, asshole!!
No.
No.
My keys?
I'm not going to give you my keys.
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc...  ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
Sure.
No, nothing.
Do I get a kiss?
Great! Go back to your files. Bye.
We live in 703.
Did I say anything?
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
That you, Rog?
Yes?
Huh?
Nothing.  Just...memories!
You got it!
I got it!  I got it!!!
Looks like 'Rest Home' for this marriage.
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Oh, Oliver, you're so tolerant. Time for a coffee before you rush off?
Yes, Betty.
Are you spoken for this evening?
YOUNG BLOOD
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
SIN-I-FUL
In the old series we didn't have a convertible.
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
It'll just take a second.
Bye.
How's the trip?
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Well, in that case...
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
Now.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
I want to go home now.
What?
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Count me out.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Huh.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile.  Here.
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
I don't want to talk about it.
You have to tell me --
What?
Let's leave it alone.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
No way. No way.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
I finished it.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
What was the bottle that did it?
Is she sleeping or...?
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
You too.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
You quit drinking?
About four weeks.
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
And I could have already put clean sheets on the other bed and the fold- out. You are staying. Wendy, Ron and the twins are picking us up at 11:30 to go to brunch at the Sheraton. They do a magnificent job there. Wendy is so excited you're coming.
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Don't touch him.
He licks his butt everyday. He's not going to mind.
That's weird.
It's called probing. It's a military procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level of danger. Make sure things are all clear...
Are you going to do this or what?
What are you doing?
Me too.
Edgar, come inside.
We can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
Don't do it.
Oh.
Dad.
I just asked his name.
What's two?
Sorry.
I would say so.
You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
That's why they got you in jail?
The one with the shotgun.
That's it.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
You must have known that before you came.
Yeah, maybe a bath.
I'll be around.
I've got a job.
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
You own this land.
The other guy drew first.
You can't do this.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
Is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
We don't serve them here and you know it. I asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. He owes me money for this damage.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Did you hear his son is still around?
I've given that up.
Don't worry about me. If you're taking on Emmett, the last place I want to be is between you.
I thought we talked about that.
We didn't talk about this.  They took the little boy, Cobb.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
So-called?
I'm saving lives here. The straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
Give me some of the good stuff.
Cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
I wouldn't worry about that.
That's right.  You understand perfectly.  I will confess to fraud, not murder.
Of course.
Why don't you just come clean, Viktor?  Tell the truth.  You'll feel better afterwards.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone.  I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
-- I'll tell you why.  It is because Miss Nicola Anders, supermodel with a SAG card God's gift to cinema, has it written into her contract that all cherry Mike & Ike's be removed from her candy dish along with strict instructions that any room she walks into should have seven packs of cigarettes waiting for her three of them opened, that there be a personal jacuzzi within eighty paces of her dressing room, and that any time she travels, her nanny must fly with her first class.
Why not?
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
I want you back too, Viktor.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
No!  Whatever talent Simone has comes from me -- me!  Me!  I swear, as God is my judge.  You don't know what I've been through.  Tens of thousands of mind-numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.  Why do you think I've been wearing these?  I may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why?  To extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being -- a human soul.  Don't you see?  I made Simone!
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Simone?
Is that a problem?
We all do.  But now I understand you're eager to get back to work -- and not the kind of work that we're all expecting.
Hello, Hal.
The film.  The chemistry.  No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
Clyde.
Really?  She didn't mention it.
There's... a wall between you --
I'm fine, Hal.  How are you?
-- Please, get away from me.
Good and bad.  They think that's what caused this.  Me eye tumor. Microwaves from the screen.  It's the size of a grapefruit.  Heavy too.
I don't know anything about computers.
You do?
"Straw God" changed my life.
I can't believe you people!  No wonder she never comes to these things!
She still with Kent?
I missed you.  I wondered if you were ever coming back.
Only her brilliance.  To be honest, with what you had to work with, I was expecting a train wreck.  You really pulled it off.
Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world.  You can lose yourself. You should get out more.  How are you going to meet boys?
I know, Hal is as stiff as always.
Really?  Too bad.
I know but Mom doesn't.  Maybe if it came from Simone, if Simone spoke to Mom -- she could straighten things out.  Dinner, maybe.
I love her but that doesn't mean I need to meet her.
It's fantastic -- it's too much.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
I could get the death penalty.
The cops?  The cops read my column to know who to bust.  We're the only watchdog the public has.  None of this is going away.  We'll be here tomorrow and the day after that.  Until you slip up.  And you will.  You are looking at your shadow.  Because all these elaborate precautions with Simone -- every instinct in my body tells me, it's not natural.
-- I've looked at every piece of publicity she's ever done, the video in the supermarket, there's no evidence she's ever left the studio.  Oh, and for some reason this woman leaves no paper trail.  But I have "obtained" a copy of your bank accounts.  I know you have power of attorney but so far you haven't transferred one single solitary cent to her.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Abduction?
I don't buy the whole recluse scam. How are you doing it?  What is it -- drugs?  Blackmail?  Mind-control? All three?  What do you do -- keep her locked in a box somewhere?
This should take care of Mother.
Dark?
Taller?  What?
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Then show some.  They'll shut me down!
Yes, I'd like that.
You could play the lead.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Let it burn.  Simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started. And now look what you've started.
Yes.  Yes, it is.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
You're right.  You're right.  Of course, one doesn't want to boast. It's a classic case of technology in search of an artist.  That's all you've been waiting for, an artist with integrity, with a vision, who can see.
Yes.  Yes, I'm going to tell the truth about you, why wouldn't I...?  Of course, with Hank's tragic passing, the secret died with him.  I am going to tell the truth... after your next picture.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
Thank you. It was a long time ago. I've kind of been retired for a while.  You're my very first client back.
Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
Why?
That I'm a freak.
Yeah. Sorry.
I forgot myself.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
What?
Never mind.
I told you what I want.
I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
Really?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
Dead people?
Stop it!
Oh yeah? Why's that?
Two.. maybe three days.
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
You... think... I... stole... your... fancy shoes? I... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
Someone actually... employs you?
Sorry.
No shit.
You know who I am. You invited me.
I don't think so.
Amends...?
Think boy. That night. The night of the fire. At the barn. You were only six years old.
Ray -- I'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
Relax. He liked what he saw. Well, some of it. Enough to give us a showcase audition. One week from today.
Yeah, that's right! I'm outta here -- Y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... I'm gone with the wind.
About what?
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
I... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
You sabotaged the bus! You kept us here... To die! First Keith, then Carl --
What a surprise. -- What about our audition?
Why bother?
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Just checking out the lights.
Well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
Hey, Grant.
He did. I know. But I got him angry 'cause I wasn't calm. This time I could --
It is. He'd been acting strange. And the physical changes. I should have told someone right away... But I was just blind. I wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... If I don't do what I can to help now, I just couldn't live with it.
Hey, Wally. Glad you're here. There was something I wanted to tell you...
Shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
Stuff you can never imagine. Feelings. Big thoughts. And love. Yeah. I'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. So, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
Grant? Why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
Is this fun?
Driving, talking to me...
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
Like what?
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
Also boring.
Running blocker.
Go.
Why are we doing this?
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Redneck heaven.
They're jammed!
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
What does the old Timex say?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
Yeah, guy?
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy. 
I'm at marker eight-five.
Then don't.
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
Bandit?
Now what?
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
Let's boogie.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Where the hell are you?
Oh.
And everybody, all the time. Yeah, it's a chore.
Based on what we had, I thought Sparazza was a mid-level player at best and it turns out he's this mob relic, running the show out west.
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
No.
He uh -- he asked about -- I'm -- he wanted to know whic-- what floor security was on, then I saw him get on the elevator with the other agent.
Mmm-hmm.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
That's not possible. I told you.
Won't work, we're just gonna have to chance it man. I'm sorry.
I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
Sparazza was the one who introduced Israel to the life, gave him his first big break, brought him through the ranks.
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
-- Brought against Sparazza by Israel's mother Laverne who was nineteen at the time. They had a brief affair which Israel was the by- product of.
It wasn't elective. It was undertaken to save his life. And it wasn't cosmetic, it was reconstructive... Look at the date of the first procedure.
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
I'm here.
-- who can say. He's off his onion, y'know, he's old school Sicilian, this is how they hate.
Right, you got clicks, anything?
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
I'm working on it.
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
Fuck you.
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
What else did Padiche say?
Can it work?
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
Her?  Who are you talking about?
I love chocolate.  I realized just yesterday how much I love it.  I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
And professionally?
My wife.
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition.  We were ready to go home.
No.
She drank liquid oxygen.
Just get him to stop.
And tonight?
You talk like an actor.
You still don't believe in God?
How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
Rheya --
But then I would be dead now.
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Why do you say that?
I'm not Snow.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Yeah.
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
Stop being nuts!
What do you want to do?
Oh God, that's great!
I think it's probably still a good idea.
You take care.
I'm all right.
You got a great ass!  I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
What shit, honey?
She's got to identify him.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Did you hear what I said?
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
No.
Even Joey Venza?!
I can't do it, you know that... He's not gonna allow it anyway, Mike.  No way is he gonna let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
I don't really see what that has to do with...
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in!  Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up!  Put him under the table!
Take care, pal.
Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Eh.  If I ever get out from under. Maybe take May to France or somethin'.
Cause if you get in a bind--
They'll never take me alive.
"Harry Osborne diminishes the stature of the University."
Screw scholarships!   Universities are death!  They make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  Burn 'em down, I say!
Listen, I do appreciate your concern, but--
Parker-- you go here, right?  Got your camera?
Double-exposures? But they're not-- I was in--
You print pictures of Bigfoot!
Would you cool it already?
Two suits by tomorrow for $400?
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Thanks, I already ate.
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
Even if you've heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
Does it have a human name?
I've gotta study.
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
This from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
You're not trained for that.  None of us are... I mean, sometimes I...  Okay, let's say you had gone back. What then?  Are you bulletproof?
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
I'm here...
Nah.
Waldos.
I'll repeat the experiment.  I will hold the truth. That's the only thing that matters.
Only Octavius knows for sure.  And last time I spoke to him, he was on the planet Whiz-Bang.
If you really apply yourself, you'll get an A next time.
No, no!  Not there!
You must have shot off your mouth all the way from Frankfurt to here.
Is you all little Adolfs?
What's the match gag?
Okay. Move on.
In this barracks?
You make my mouth water.
You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
Forget it.
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
Look, Lieutenant. All your dough won't help you here. Because here you're on your own. And no mother to throw you a lifebelt. Now let's see how good you can swim.
Not you.
What some brandy?
Let's!
105-353.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
Oh, come now! You threw a time bomb.
I want to talk about Lieutenant Dunbar. Is this Lieutenant Dunbar?
Then droppen Sie dead!
Ja -- ja! Droppen Sie dead! Always mit the jokes! Droppen Sie dead!
Why do you do this to me every morning?
No you don't! You don't want any broads with boots on!
Not for me! Betty! Betty!
So it is from the finance company. So it's better than no letter at all. So they want the third payment on the Plymouth.  So they want the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the seventh. So they want the Plymouth.
Hey, here's Esther Williams.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Of course. I'm aware of the Geneva Convention. They will be given the burial they deserve. Or perhaps you would suggest we haul in twenty-one cannons from the Eastern Front and give them a twenty-one gun salute?
Wait a second, Hoffy. Schulz says he's our best friend. Maybe he can give us a little hint.
Good.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
Are we boring you?
I'll say it is. You spilled a little borscht on it.
Sure I heard it. I still got one good ear.
Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
You did!
You can tell Father Murray to --
Give this to Joey, will you?
They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
Three hundred and sixty-fifth Bomb Squadron? Out of Chelveston?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
What time?
Ja, ja, gewiss! It is only that we are cramped for space with new prisoners every day.  Gentlemen! Outside! Please! Do you want me to have trouble with the Kommandant again!
You are trying to say that an American would inform on other Americans?
Give me the radio.
Ich weiss alles.
Here. Take them.
And how about three hundred cigarettes for yourself?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
What was I going to do with them? I only smoke cigars.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
He is.
Give me a list of those effects. I want to know every single thing which has been altered or changed, no matter how insignificant.
And destroy every planet in the system.
That is true. However, I believe my growth as an artificial lifeform has reached an impasse. For thirty-four years I have endeavored to become more "human"- to grow beyond my original programming. And yet I am still unable to grasp such a simple concept as humor. This emotion chip is the only answer.
I believe the beverage has provoked an emotional response.
Perhaps.  Yes! If we sent a low-level ionic pulse, it might reset the coil and engage the cloaking systems.
Signal the closest starship. We're in no condition to mount a rescue. We don't even have a full crew aboard.
I'll go. You have the Bridge.
There's some buckling on the starboard nacelle.  We've also got a hull breach in the Engineering section. Emergency forcefields are in place and holding.
Oh yes. I remember everyone who was on the Lakul, every face. Even the ones who didn't make it.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?
Temporal nexus, yeah, I heard you.  Something's missing.
I take it the odds are against us and the situation is grim?
Load torpedo bays, prepare to fire on my command.
I always do.
No, I didn't know that.
We think they were looking for something- they practically tore the place apart.
No, sir.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
My brother had shouldered that burden, allowing me to pursue my own selfish needs.
All automates ready and functioning. Automatic moorings retracted. All speeds available through transwarp drive.
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
I went wrong.
... Fascinating.
A photon tube...!
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
... Or <u>who</u>.
I don't understand.
Eight weeks, sir.  But you don't have eight weeks so I'll do it for ya in two.
They've knocked out the damn automation center.  I've got no control over anything!
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
Yes, sir. It's getting larger as we close in.
With some on the planet...
What about surface life signs...?
Go, Sulu!
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
My friends, the great experiment: Excelsior, ready for trial runs...
Welcome home, Jim.
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
May I ask why...?
Yours...?!

You should take the Vulcan, too.
You missed the point, then and now... Only his body was "in death," Kirk! And you were the last one to be with him.
Of course...!
... Or the one.
You must bring them to Mount Selaya -- on Vulcan. Only there is the passage possible. Only there can both find peace...
If I hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
I trust my instincts.  Admiral Kirk. This is your opponent speaking.
I underestimated him... He did the one thing I didn't anticipate ... He destroyed himself...
Killing his son was <U>stupid</U>! It made Kirk willing to die.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Not anymore! Now you can do both at the same time! According to myth, the earth was created in six days. Watch out: here comes Genesis; we'll do it for you in six minutes --
Would you like to tell me whose are the <u>right</u> hands, my cold-blooded friend? Are you in favor of these experiments?
Twenty-two, eighty-three...
Say thank you.
Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
Dr. Marcus... good. We're en route to you and should be there in three days.
... see you but can't hear. Did you... order...?
Is that a poem?
Par for the course... you teaming up with me for bridge after dinner?
Mother, go back!
You do that and you'll have murdered your father.
What's the matter -- ?
Umm. And would Admiral Kirk have access to such information?
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
You realize, sir, that they will attempt to contact Admiral Kirk and confirm the order.
We encoded four minutes --
We'll beam aboard and stop it --
Are you running away from me?
I'm trying, David.
Locking phasers on target.
Raise the shields...
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
Chekov, who is this man?
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
First things first, Captain. Kill Admiral Kirk.
Oh? A wee bout of what, Mr. Scott?
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Not at present.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
I was going to remind you of nothing, least of all that which you know well.  Your mistake, if I may be so bold, was promotion. Commanding a Starship is your first best destiny. Anything else is a waste of material.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
The power of creation --
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
Regula is class "D'. It consists of various remarkable ores. Essentially, a great rock in space.
Steady as you go...
I have an urgent CommPic from Space Lab Regula I for the Admiral. Dr. Carol Marcus.
Yes, sir.
... No, sir. It has not.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
We learn by doing, Lieutenant.
Energize defense fields.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
On the test, sir, will you tell me what you did? I'd really like to know.
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
Aye, sir.
Understood, sir.
Stop engines.
Inform the Klingons we are on a rescue mission...
Never, sir.
Aye, sir.
The question is irrelevant.
Not at all. You gave me things to think about. You always do. You do sound a little wrecked, why don't you go home and stare at the ceiling?
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Forget it...  How 'bout covering a little philosophical ground? Life, Death, Life... Things of that nature?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
And Admiral, it's the Enterprise.
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
"Neutralized?" How?
Can you protect us?
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
Why's that?
Iowa.
Can I ask <u>you</u> something?
Good.  A large mushroom and pepperoni with extra onions. And a Michelob.
It's not so much a matter of a place as of time.
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
... Who are you?
Think about it -- but don't take too long because I'm out of time. If you change your mind, this is where I'll be.
They were taken last night. I wasn't told. They're in Alaska by now.
Well, I... find that understandable  I mean, you've been through a lot.  Station, please.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
Quite right, Spock. Mr. Chekov, engage cloaking device!
Where would we find these reactors... Theoretically.
Exaggerate.
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
Right.  Will you help us?
We'll divide into teams. Commanders Chekov and Uhura are assigned to the Uranium problem.
Wing to cruise configuration... Full impulse power.
Right.  Now look: I want you all to be very careful. This is terra incognita. Many customs will doubtless take us by surprise. It's a forgone conclusion these people have never seen an extra-terrestrial before.
Bearing 327, range 600 nautical.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
It takes two to tango, Mr. Scott.
Mr. Sulu, if you please.
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Thank you, Lt. Saavik.
If you'll follow me, Professor --
... But it would take years just to figure out the dynamics of this matrix...!
Old, yes. But interesting.  Do you mind if I ask a few questions...?
I will be returning to Vulcan within the hour... I wanted to take my leave of you.
Most kind, Father.
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
To move you off this planet. You go to sleep one night in your village... wake up the next morning in this flying holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you've been relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.
But not you.
You'll stop reviewing what happened yesterday... stop planning for tomorrow... until you find...  Let me ask you a question -- have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?
There are caves in those mountains.
Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice...  Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Sometimes I do.
Why not...?
Won't he rust?
You're aboard the Enterprise.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
All I know is that he was functioning normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was activated...
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
That's your expert opinion?
Options?
Nothing dangerous turned up in the astrometric survey...
Slow to impulse. We're on our way.
Transferring controls to manual.
Yew-cheen chef-faw... emphasis on the 'cheen' and the 'faw'...
Why was Data assigned?
Hmm, I should feel right at home with them...
What...?
Or you could try lying down.
Your scanners must be malfunctioning.
I look forward to reading your report.
Yes...
That'll be interesting.
It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread...
That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet.
Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always.
Where's the Sphere?
Understood. Keep me informed.
Get a tricorder. You're going to have to track my exact position in that room...
Entering the upper ionospere...
There's a red light on the second intake valve.
I'm on it...
What about our warp signature? It has to be strong enough for them to detect.
Huh.
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
The invasion plans.
What makes you say that?
Some.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
Why?
This may be hard for you to understand... but I'm duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Aye, sir.
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Computer -- thermal enhancement.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
And Commander, whatever you do... do <U>not</U> vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant.
Nothing.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Wil... Data was down there.
Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back.
Commander... we have a problem.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
That's the question -
Starfleet's killed an awful lot of natural phenomena in the name of "exploration"...
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
Did you have occasion to refer to your ship's data banks during that night?
And what did they tell you?
Aye, sir; thrusters...
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
Don't you know? Everyone on Rura Penthe is here for life.
You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
I'm telling you. Hang on.  How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
I'm going to sleep it off. Let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
From Enterprise?
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was...
Spock, you want to know something?
I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
Curious. You haven't been assisting Commander Uhura with her radio transmissions, have you, Lt?
Even logic must give way to physics. Gravity hadn't been restored by the time they escaped. Without their boots they would not have stayed on the Klingon transporter pads.
I don't want to.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
I believe I am.
Even assuming you're correct, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own President?
Well, what about all that atmospheric equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
I was in space for a long time. Then a ship belonging to the Talosians" picked me up. They asked me where I came from. I told them people called the Pakleds" took me from my homeworld. They are fat
I am in a room with lights.
How long is that?
If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out. Level one medical emergency.  Theres no crying in Starfleet.
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
I think a skin cells the more likely of the two.
You're working late.
Yes.
New worlds. Yes Data, brave new worlds...
At our current velocity we will arrive at sector 3274 in approximately 40 minutes.
It's possible the extra memory port is interfering with the engram processing. Mind if I keep him here and run some diagnostics?
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
I don't know.
What if we target all phasers in a concentrated attack?
Sir?
Come now, a big, strapping fellow like you? What are you afraid of?
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
It's working.
Patience. Diplomacy is a very exacting occupation. We can wait.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Praetor Shinzon. Were not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
And the Senate supports you?
Yes.
You know I do.
A lifetime of violence will do that. My nose was broken four times. And my jaw... But so much is the same. The eyes, you recognize the eyes.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
How did you end up on Remus?
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
Think about what you're doing, Shinzon. Are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?
I think the facts speak for themselves. The same noble Picard blood runs in our veins. Had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as I am. Look in the mirror, and see yourself.
I have little interest in your quaint vessel, Captain. If the Enterprise will withdraw to a distance of one hundred light years, it will not be harmed.
Not so long.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
I don't know.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
My time. I'll spend it how I choose.
Do as I tell you!
What?!
It's imperative we retain their allegiance or our great mission will be strangled before it can truly draw breath.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
I don't want to scare them away.
I don't see anything.
It's there. The fog's thicker now, but it's there. What do you think started those fires?
Thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
What do you do?
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Elmo's...
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
What's all this for?
That's the chance we have to take.
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
What.
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
You'll see.
Space?
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
Eh... yes...
What is hitchhike?
The driver will...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
Please stay.
What?
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Yes.
I am your friend.
Yes.
You can have one.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
The cook.
I can't stay on this planet.
I will. I will. We still have another day.
Goodbye.
Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
What? No, of course not.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
A star is born.
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
Oh my God.  I don't believe this is happening.
I'm not.  Just a little poach job.
I know.  I don't always do exactly what I'm told.  So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?'  And you said -- come on Max.
Uh huh.  And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me.  I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Let it alone, Lenny.  It'll take care of itself.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Thanks, Max.  I'm touched by your concern.
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
He stalks her.  He rapes her.  Then he does her...
So she feels... what he feels... while he's in her.  The thrill while he's killing her... is sent to her, heightening her fear... which in turn heightens the turn on for him.  I've seen a lot, Max.
Okay... what about Strickland?
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
You must be so pleased, I followed your jellybean trail right here, like a good little chump.
With all the blood I guess they didn't see the rig.  Guy had it under a wig.
Fuck that!  The last part's the best.  You dry-dive six stories and blammo!  Jack right into the Big Black.
Yeah, well, the first part's okay. Better than the usual soaps you bring me.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
What else you got?
What clip?  What was it?
That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Yeah, but that was for love.
Mr. Fumitsu, good evening sir, Leonard Nero, Security Express. Lornette Mason here is just completing our routine driver evaluation.  We do it to make sure that out VIP clients, such as yourself, are always treated as honored guests.  I just need to ride up front and take some notes, if you don't mind.
Get it.
You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies?
Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
I have crawled through the gutter... through every wrinkle in the human brain.
S'okay.  I know you still love me.
She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Well, look at the plus side.
Deputy Commissioner Palmer Strickland.  The sanctimonious prick who busted me out.  His ass is so tight when he farts only dogs can hear it.  I know this guy.  If there's one cop who's not dirty it's him.
I guess.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created.  It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
What's the bad news?
What does the Manager say?
I sent a female in. The room in question was rented by an Anglo, cash; since then, nothing -- no activity, no phone response.
Got a sister like this, what they call it, anal? That's her.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
What do you want from me?
Put a BOLO out on that.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
If my Reporting Agent could be someone outside Computer Crimes, perhaps Agent Kulok?
Okay, Harold Speck: who goes first?
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
How long ago?
You knew the arm slash was not "Zorro."
It was neither a valid concept nor a valid fact. Suspect Zero came to represent every killer Dick Low had not caught. The idea took root in his head like a wild irrational vine. For someone like Low, there would always be a Suspect Zero. We couldn't let Richard go where that idea was taking him.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
No, no, no, most of them -- I used to think all of them -- are just fantasists, guys who get off telling degrading stories. When I came across this fugitive chat room, listened in, I started to think some might actually be real, that they'd gone live. The challenge was to figure out which was which. Then I had my disagreement with Koessler.
And one other thing.
Because you asked him to, stupid.
Not yet. Not about this, either.
We did find these, however.
Then there's the other issue.
What's that?
I just need to go a little slow.
I need something tangible. To hook him. I told him I'd found the confidential file on the Suspect Zero theory.
That's what Koessler wants us to believe. To discredit Low.
But it was your idea: "use Zero," you said, use Zero to get Low.
Agent Kulok, could you wipe my face?
I'll be back.
Yes.
How's the arm?
He couldn't break an egg with a hammer. He still writing those crime porn books?
So you went underground?
I don't carry it with me.
Zero killed them all?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Hello, Agent Mackelway. How's the watch? Maybe you can do one of those TV commercials, I found my watch under a serial killer's heart and it was still ticking.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
[What does the file say?]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Johnny, get this man's file. Mackelway, right?
Got a vehicle?  Head north on 54. When you get to New Mexico you've gone too far.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
Take your shirt off.
You're right. I know.
Are you calling Her?
What kind of car do you drive?
Are you sure? Maybe...
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
Thank you, Nikki.
I like quiche.
How?
...and even then...
What else is going on?
You haven't told then, huh?
I still haven't told my folks I didn't get "Deepspace 9". You'd think they'd'a figured it out by now, but Mom keeps asking...
I'm a "Dorothy".
You want this in black chips.
Already? You poor thing. It won't last.
I'll be around.
Yeah. And an actor.
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Good eye. Not one club owner got it. They all ask me why I got Donald Duck on my card.
...It's really getting late.
...Which one...?
I can call back...
Yeah.
You know, us.
It sucks.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
There's the rub.
There's the rub.
Hey man, don't sweat it.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
What do you want? You're tall.
Oh no?
It's like, every day I see a beautiful woman. I'm not used to that. I'm used to seeing a beautiful woman, I don't know, once a week. I can't handle it.
It's unbelievable.
Go for it, man.
She wasn't your type anyway.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
...for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
He's trying to be an actor.
Not well.
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Don't call me ever again.
We're gonna spend half the night driving around the Hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we're gonna look for this other party you heard about. But, Trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. I spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who's eyes are darting around to see if there's someone else she should be talking to. And it's like I'm supposed to be all happy cause she's wearing a backpack. Half of them are nasty skanks who wouldn't be shit if they weren't surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I'm not gonna be one of those assholes. It's fucking depressing. Some skank who isn't half the woman my girlfriend is is gonna front me? It makes me want to puke.
What are you talking about? Vegas?
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
Vegas!
Look at it, baby. Vegas, baby!
We're gonna get laid, baby.
What?!?
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Always.
You won. There's nothing to be sorry about. You're a winner. I'm the fuckin loser. I should be sorry.
She likes you.
...Baby...
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
Right?... that I nailed it... Whatever. Then he says it's just that I'm a little old. I'm like "How old is the Brother?". He's like, he says this with a straight face, I swear to God, he says "Eleven."
What?
Hold on.
Sorry about interrupting...
Don't worry about me, baby. I just wanted you to have a good time.
She was hot.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
Michelle went for you, right.
That was different.
Don't remind me.
You just sat around drinking orange juice. Now look at you. Look how far you've come in just a few months. You got that part in that movie...
I hear she's getting real fat.
Minnie Pearl.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
You asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
Be smart about it.
Beautiful. What time are you off...  ...Christy?
Then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, Bonasera.  But if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...
Barzini.
Ba Fa Goulle.
Maybe three, four times.  I always asked Freddie if he wanted another bodyguard, but he said no.  Things have been so smooth the last ten years...
No, just you and Paulie.
No, I don't want to give Barzini an excuse to start fighting.
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Holy cow, I don't gotta know nothing.
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
You mean Tattaglia.
For bravery.
And now, what do you choose to do?
No, I wanted other things for you.
You are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men.  I hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over.  That was my misfortune.  That was your misfortune.  I was hunted on the streets of Corleone when I was twelve years old because of who my father was.  I had no choice.
I'll need him.
Nazorine, my friend, tell me what I can do.
Godfather, you understand everything.
I know.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
I was told that my Grandfather was murdered on its main street; and his murderers came to kill my father there when he was twelve years old.
Is that why there are more men on the walls?
How do you know I come from America?
This was a beauty.  Right, Calo?
No.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Mike!
The Don has semi-retired.  I'm running the Family business now. So anything you have to say, say it to me.
Can you do it Mike?
No more stalemate Tom, we got the soldiers, we'll match them gun for gun if that's how they want it. They know me for what I am, Tom-- and they're scared of me.
Nobody knows where he is.  We know he's all right, but that's all.
If I accept that letter and you told a Court of Law I accepted it, they would interpret it as my having knowledge of his whereabouts. Just wait Kay, he'll contact you.
Good...then you can go...  I don't like violence.  I'm a businessman, and blood is a big expense.
You smooth son of a bitch, let me lay it on the line for you, and your boss.  Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.  I don't care how many Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball Goombahs come out of the woodwork!
How will they come at you?
They're going to talk to my father, which means they're going to ask him for something, which means they better get it right.
And what do you want for Christmas?
Michael...
Huh?
Goodbye.
We'll go to the show tomorrow night--we can change the tickets.
I'm busy.
You just stand here one minute...
All right, Sonny.  All right.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
A million times.
Forgive me, Godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. How can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up?  The two  go hand in hand. And with you gone from here the Barzini and the Tattaglias will be too strong for us.
Your casino loses money.  Maybe we can do better.
Is that why you thought you could slap Freddie around in public?
I think so, but I can't get close enough.  There's a lot of blood. I'll try to find out more.
Okay, darling.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Okay.  And did we know each other?
Say again?
I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you $1000.
This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz.
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
Sure. I love Venice.
She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. 
I didn't mean with you in it.
You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry.
I thought you'd missed the train.
That's good.
I love Marge.
What evening?
What? I think I'm saying it. Something's going on. He's either converted to Christianity -- or to something else.
I'll try my best, sir. Obviously I'll do anything to help Dickie.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Marge has been telling us about the rings.
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
Such as?
Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts --
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Hello Marge!
I can explain.
I don't believe you.
It's all true.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
No glasses.
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
Hello.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward.
I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later?
You know what -- I am.
He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie... disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder.
A ragione. A ragione. 
I don't know how to translate that.  E difficile... il signor Ripley... dormiva all'aperto, con un...
No.  By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient.
But you're still tormented, you must be, you've killed somebody...
Probably. In my case it's probably a whole building.
You try. You try talking to her.
Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Meredith Logue. You were kissing somebody. Looked like Meredith.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Peter, I... I...
I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends.
It is a little coarse, yes.
Good. The Goldoni. Yes -- you're right. A coincidence.  I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto.
That's the Colt .25 -- a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125.
Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building.
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
You want to canvass?
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
Well, Betsy mam, I drive a taxi at night.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
Thank you, Travis.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
That would have been quite a coincidence.
I didn't mean you. But just ordinary people. A guy I know -- Dough-Boy -- met his wife that way. They got to talking. She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
What hours do you work?
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
You know what you remind me of?
I didn't mean that, Travis. Just the part about the contradiction.
Kris Kristofferson.
Can I call you?
Hello, Betsy.
Thank you, Travis.
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
This I gotta see.
I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
Now look more closely. Look around the eyes and chin. See? See there?
We don't have ju-jukes. We don't have Coca-Cola. We only got Royal Crown Cola.
That's a dollar forty-seven.
A real skunk.
What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
Stick up?
Well... I guess so.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
Iris.
It don't matter. I'm gonna get you outta here. 
Oh, come off it, man.
I can leave anytime I want.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
What's so important?
You a narc?
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
Why, thank you Travis.
I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors.
There's porno theatres for that.
I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it.
Listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
Also clean.
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
Your name Sport?
What's going on?
Hey Wizard.
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Shoot. They don't call me the Wizard for nothing.
It happens.
Like do anything, you know.
What do you expect, Bertrand Russell? I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know?  I don't even know what you're talking about.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Don't worry, Killer. You'll be all right.  I seen enough to know.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
What is happening?  Where's Mason?
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
No. I'm going to give you dancing lessons.  What the fuck do you think?
Find the rockets.  If they're guarded, kill the men guarding them.
It's about time.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
It's possible.
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the record.
No identification at all.  What're you thinkin', Cecil?
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
I can only imagine.  You know, I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands.  I don't think he gave it very much thought.
Ah.
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to.
... Ernie.
Yes?
They're...
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Anybody take it?
What.
Sandra Sinclair.
Thanks.
It's possible.  I just don't remember.
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
What's his rent?
They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party.  On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Some of it might come back to you.
Yeah... me too.
Thanks.
The customers?  I don't know...
You mean, he was... let go, too?
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
Who?
Would that be Miss Sinclair?
All right.  All right.  We'll see.
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
I see.
Yes?
Oh, I suppose so.
Could I have a puff?
Just a little one.
Darling, of course I do!
I think they'll be all right, honey.
The little Brenner girl.
It's Alice.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
The two kids?
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Mmmm.
It's a surprise, you see.
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
I don't know what good that'll do.  Chickens won't eat.
She was selling birds.
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
That's a chance we have to take.
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
Where will we go?
I'm sorry, Mitch.
Oh, my God, look at her!
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
I started to say... inside...
You don't have to.
Then he saw.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I don't mind, really.
We know what it is, Al.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
'Cause sometimes birds are attracted by light, you know.  Sure is a peculiar thing.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
These birds were...
Goodnight, Lydia.
Monday?
I said I wonder if you could help me.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
All right.  She smiles back.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
I think you're a louse.
Do you practice here?
I'm sorry.  What are you doing up here?
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Right next to the one you already had.
You are, aren't you?
Maybe.
His wife changed the channel.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
Yes.
I told you what happened in Rome!
Cheers.
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
No, thank you.
It's an uprising.
Growing a beard...
So they united.
With my little sparrow leading team.
Melanie...
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Santa Rosa?
Almost two a.m.
How about you?
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
Well, all right, but...
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. 
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
They are incapable of organized warfare!
Then let's go. Now!
Good.
But Gray's only a cab driver -- a Resurrection Man who robs graves to make a bit of money now and again.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
I'm afraid I have to, sir.  You see, my father is vicar at Thrums -- it's a small parish -- not much of a living --
What the devil do you mean?  You have your lodgings, a certain stipend -- I thought I had arranged everything for you --
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
This girl was beautiful -- a wild lassie from the Highlands.
Gray -- I'm rid of him --
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
Not yet.
One shouldn't get used to the wrong things, Georgina.  You want to walk and run and play.
But you'll have to stand great pain, Georgina.  Greater pain than you ever dreamed of in the worst time of your sickness.  Do you want it that much?
You will not have it?
That's a good boy, Toddy.
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
I'll tell you what, Toddy. It's because I ran down the streets with the mud and the stones around my ears and the mob yelling for my blood. It's because you were afraid to face it -- and you're still afraid.
I have no wish for a rope cravat. I've never liked the smell of hemp, so I'll bid you good night, Doctor MacFarlane.
This is a gift.
The Resurrection business? That may end sooner than you think. New laws may come.
I would make you rich.
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
Aye.  He's a good lad.  That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
I'm looking for my friends.
See, I heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. How's that going? You find him? Yes? No?
Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
We won't.
I was hoping you'd find out.
There's no scar, you freak. The Corvis kid made it up.
I don't know you, man.
Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis.  Exhibit A.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
Who are you?
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
Why? Why's anything happen? It's all money, man. Money. The girl just got in the way.
Stay away from me! Dad! Dad!
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
No. You don't.
It's not. I can't take it.
Good for you. You do know something.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
Just hold on to me.
It still doesn't mean...
He said he'd prove it.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
If you mean that you are afraid of us--
Would you care to be more specific?
I'm afraid you have no alternative. In such, a case the planet Earth would have to be--  --eliminated.
I assure you such power exists.
Yes.
That can easily be arranged.
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
Tell me what?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
They have cemeteries. But not like this one... You see, they don't have any wars.
We went to the movies -- and we had ice cream cones -- and we went to see Daddy--
And the lungs are the same as ours. Must mean a similar atmosphere -- similar pressure.  How old do you think he is?
I intend to explain. To all the nations -- simultaneously.  How do we proceed, Mr. Harley?
Then why not a meeting of all the Chiefs of State?
I've been dealing in Earth's politics a good deal longer than you have.  Goodnight, sir.
I'm sorry. I guess I'm just tired of hearing about Mr. Carpenter.  I don't like the way he's attached himself to you and Bobby. After all, what do you know about him?
Is it real?
You think it's all right for you to stay here?
Important? Of course it's important. The point is we can do something about it.
He's a menace to the whole world! It's our duty to turn him in.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Naturally I think so.
Warm and friendly and intelligent--  You know -- he's the only real friend I've made since I've been here.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
May I see you for a minute?
Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
What time is it?
I can see no other hope for your planet. If the meeting should fail, then I'm afraid there is no hope.
I'm worried about Gort. I'm afraid of what he might do -- if anything should happen to me.
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
You might keep this.  I think the professor will want to get in touch with me.
I'd give you a very good price.
That's right.
Well, how do I know who you are?
Can't stand light?
Yeah.
He's my brother.
You gotta drive!
That's just the way we like it.
Those two we brought back with us. The girl and the kid.  I don't trust 'em.  I say we terminate 'em while we can.
C'mon, Star.  Climb on.
Get your bike.  We're going someplace.
No.  Stick around.
I will, David!
His fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
Good!
I like Michael.
I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  Will you stay home with Sam tonight?  I'm meeting Max for dinner after work.
In here?
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Not funny, Sam!
Stop it, Sam.  Stop it right now!
Not another word!  I can't believe you're doing this.  I'm going to see Max tonight and you're trying to ruin it for me again.
Hi, Thorn.
I know.  It's so 'Eighties.'  It's the Cute Decade.
I guess if I had my choice, I'd like to do something that involves children.  Work with kids in some way.  Teenagers, maybe.  And Santa Carla seems to be full of them.
Oh, right.  I always gets those two confused.
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
Boys Sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Ex-hippies.  My mom was one.   I came this close to being called Moon Child, or Moon Beam or something.  But Star's great.  I <u>like</u> Star.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Let's go see them.
I'm weak... Soon I'll need to feed.
Take laddie.
No.  Why?
No.
Nanook...
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
Don't kill anybody until we get back to you...
Ah... He was hurt bad.  Bullet nicked an artery... I don't know... An hour... hour and a half...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Sure.  You think there's a connection?
Damn you, Blair!  You've already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
He's so close.  Maybe our best chance to blow him away.
Look, I haven't been near that... that refrigerator.
You lying bastard...
That's impossible, man!  Okay, Clark, out of the john where I can see you!
Childs, you got the torch?  You get your ass in here!!
Garry's missing!
The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
Didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them.
You reach anybody yet?
And that was enough?
Norris looked pretty dead, himself. Bullets don't kill these Things.
Why?
If he's one of those Things, we've got to get to him before he changes... Nauls, you and Childs and I'll check the outside shacks...
He's one of them.
This is it?
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Do you know where they live?
Yes... Are you sure you want to do this?
Trust me... You don't want to see any more.
How are your dreams now?
I'm going to end it, Alexander.  As we discussed...
You wouldn't understand.  We genetically engineered the Morlock class to serve our needs.
It can't all be like this...
We have lost the capacity to reproduce.  But the species must continue.
Does this prove something to you? Have you made some great stand of which I'm unaware?
I just love mechanical things.
Got here as soon as I could.
Talk away, Professor.
Not here... alone.  May we? Please?
Your birth stone.  I thought --
All right...
Alex, it's just the zoo.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Where's the challenge in that?
But shouldn't it be better? Shouldn't we be teaching our students to imagine a world beyond all this?
How romantic...
It wasn't your fault, Alex.
I can't leave when I'm so close.
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
Good night, Alex.
We all have that dream.
It's always been this way here.  We work on the towers all our lives. When we're young we train to be planners or climbers or sculptors...
It sounds like a wonderful place to live.
If you only knew...
I know what it is to lose someone. When my husband was taken from us... I thought the pain would never end.
Tell him to go away --
That'll be all.
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
Yes, sir.
Kalen, right now you need to go up to bed.  You're exhausting Alexander.
No, you're safe --
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
For our sake, I hope not.
I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
Should we be...
We never should have done this to him...
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
Sit down, Mr. Starks! Sit down, Mr. Starks!
They make it hard for you to get away with your business, huh?
Yes.
You killed him?
[Beat] You're his son?
No. I'm not his son. I'm him. [Beat] What? You look like you've seen a ghost. You can come here and touch me, old man. I'm the real thing.
I don't understand...
No. [Beat] You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket.
Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
Sure.
Jackie, get in the car. NOW!
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
[Beat] What?
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
What?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
I know.
Why?
I don't know.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
You thought my father was crazy?
But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was...
Because I don't have time.
And how do you know that?
You still don't believe me, do you?
You did, in the future. You figured it out because a part of you already knows this. That's how it works. [Beat] I'm just telling you something you already know, even if you haven't realized it.
What are you talking about?
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
Well, you definitely didn't pick normal or simple this time either.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. [Beat] So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
So you never knew your mother?
What?!
Well then, it's a good thing you're not regional manager and I am.
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband.  But it wasn't either one of those two.  The tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
What for?
I'm spinning.
Yeah, you're startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Shut up.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Well, I robbed a gas station once, and I robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. And that's it.
Well, I was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' I was good at so I...
God.  You're a real live outlaw!
You're a little angle, you are.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Who's your friend?
What the fuck is going on?
Okay.
Who did it?
It's nothin' like that.
Oh yeah.
You wanna come with me, please? Walk around and get in the car, please.
I'll call you right back.
I wanna take it anyway.  Just in case.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
Get the car!
I don't know.  Just tell 'em what happened.
He said "Okay, Thelma.  I just wanted to know you were alright.  I hope you're havin' a good time.  You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  I love you, honey."
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy.  He knows how to chase and that's it.  Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do.  So he runs away.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend.  You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
What for?
Idaho?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Before.
What little dogs?
I can see that.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
What?!  What about him?!
Now, Thelma, that is not...
... in Texas... didn't it?  That's what happened... Oh my God.
You know why.  You already said.
What'd I say again?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
What?
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
Me too.  I feel awake.
I wanna get a job.  I wanna work at Club Med.
It'd have to be pretty good.
It would have to be pretty damn good.
Oh.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
Fresno.
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
Good-looking?
Yeah, right.
Why not?
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
Check.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
'That right?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Yep.
By the way, what's your name?
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
What's that?
-- He's in a cage?!
That sounds like fun.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
-- Love story of our time.
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Sure.
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
I don't buy it.
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
She's in a wheelchair?!
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Think about it. You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and right next to it you see Seven- Minute Abs -- which one you gonna spring for?
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you said you were putting her up for a month -- it's been a year and a half.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
Good lookin'?
What's a mook?
Why?
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
No, it was a good thing.  I mean, good in that it was very quick.
Oh great, I ran out.
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Okay.
You forgot your keys!
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
No, that's really unneces --
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Uh-huh.
Complete snowjob. And then we went out and told the country they weren't putting missiles into Cuba.  By the way, you realize we just lost the midterms.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
Then you'll call, right?
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We've got bigger problems right now.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
Yeah, but the country didn't even exist as a country yet. It was a mess, and he didn't have a leg to stand on.
Helen and I went out for breakfast. EXCOM's not supposed to convene til eight.
Just wanted to see for myself.  They're burning their documents.
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
Yeah.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
What's happened?
I said his heart, not his attention.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
I, uh...
In the morning I'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. McNamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon, keep an eye on things there.
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. There's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. They're going to be shot at, plain and simple.
If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
Okay, Ken. We're going.
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
I'm afraid not, Mr. President. The sub has positioned itself between the Pierce and the Soviet ships. Admiral Anderson insists it's too much of a risk to proceed with stopping the freighters. The Pierce would be a sitting duck for the sub.
I see.
A murder. On the reservation.
Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
You're a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.
Who the fuck is he?
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. It's a known fact out here that he's petrified of driving. His parents were killed in a car wreck.
Yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy's gonna show. And I want you to make the collar.
He's out there. He's out there playing Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I'm getting a bleeding ulcer.
She's that subtle?
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
-- never mind Eagle Bear. We've got Jimmy nailed. Let's go!
Cuz I want New York.
You didn't tell me about Red Deer Table --
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
After we've completed our investigation.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don't worry, we don't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That's a white man's myth. This is a sacrament.
He said he doesn't know.
The connection is, it did a head number on him. He's petrified of cars. Won't drive. I've known him all my life, and he's never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger and he rides horses, and that's it. The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you're wearing.
A what?
What you call myths, we call our history.
What are you talking about?
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
-- Leo was an apple, that's right. Red on the outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a coupla times. But he didn't kill him.
Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over again.
NO.  My father never told anybody he had Indian blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called me Washee. Said it meant... good boy.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Get up!
How the hell do you know?
What's Tashka Sha, speak English, speak English!
It's not that.
I heard of one once.
Yeow!
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
Two meters.
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
How about what?
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
You ever think about killing another human being?
You want to go ballistic?
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
And now?
I don't know yet.
You ever fly an F-14? 
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
Not to me.
I want it back.
I like to play "reality".
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
Lieutenant... What do you... usually fly?
Remember one thing.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
What is he doing?
He's pissing me off!
This is crazy!
What is?
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
Since when did you care about paperwork?
280, 290, 300 knots.
3,000 feet.  We gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
Then...shit! Go ahead. I'm right behind you.
Any more MiGs?
Did what?
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
What'd you do?
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
Well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
I talked a man back once. Three months later, we lost him. It's his decision. Only he knows.
Yes sir!
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
He was by the book, all the way.
Cheap domes.  And no air to screen out the rays.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
Thank you.
So why am I still alive?
Sorry.  Too perfect.
My friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  Fire it up, Doc.
You're nothing!  You're nobody!  You're a stupid dream.  Well all dreams come to an end.
I'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
Lori says he can't remember jack shit!
Yes, sir.
Great!  Because, otherwise I'll erase your ass.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Not really.  I've just always been fascinated by Mars.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
Well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
What about the girl?  Brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  Is that a coincidence?
O.K., everybody pull out!
Cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
Wrong.  Kuato's a mutant.  So don't get upset when you see him.
They sell fake memories.
"RekallRekallRekall."  You thinkin' of goin' there?
You went to Rekall, remember?
Tell me!
But I'm always home by morning.
You think I'm an idiot?  Remember our wedding?
Beats me.  I just work here.
Good to see ya. Right this way.
Hauser?  You're Hauser.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
You two-faced-bastard.
Aliens?!
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.
My cannon.
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
Son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Well, I'm a victim of circumstance.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
It's out last one.  We can't kill them all.
Yeah...but no ties.
You're not civil, you're glum.  We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
What?
You are so full of shit...
Damn, Fred, you can't give away all those.
God, what a stink!
Yes, see, they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  But they can't move through solid rock. I think we should travel west to the mountains.
They're working together, too.
Like <u>what</u>?!  There's nothing left that'll make it to the mountains!
Please... I need to sleep...
I don' need a hospital... I feel fine.
True.
Where's the nearest hospital?
-- With objection!
Your Honor, the witness' response was non-responsive... I ask you to strike it from the record...!
-- The Nazi he knifed?
Chuckie's address. I sneaked a peek at the Rolodex.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
What's Art Esparza?
Neither.
And I call your testimony hearsay. I have no more questions for you.
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
I lied.
Have you considered that Chuckie Roeder's not calling himself Chuckie Roeder these days? Get his mugshot from one of the many law officers who've got hotpants for you... then canvass those art supplies places. We're gonna win this one, Kitty, but ya gotta believe...
I haven't paid you.
Want to tell me what went down here?
Racist asshole came at me.
About Chinatown. What went down.
"No," what?
Y-yes, sir.
Did the police make any attempt to phone you, to follow up?
I never joke about waiving a client's Sixth Amendment right to trial.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
Isn't it a standard trick to pack a line-up with men who resemble each other but look different than the suspect, so the suspect will stand out for the eyewitnesses?
Badgering.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
And its purpose?
For control of the prison drug trade?
If a member of the Aryan Brothers tries to cut in on your distribution?
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
Yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, Cooper?
I want you to kill for me.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
Well, where are you going?
I am going over here.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Was there an argument?
You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
OK, Gordon.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Okay, Gordon!!!
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Sorry to hear it.
Ever see her with someone else?
No.  Ask Irene over there.
No.
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Gordon said you were good. The tailored dress is our code for drugs. Did you notice what was pinned to it?
I see. He does talk loud.
That's what I heard.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
No, Sam, I'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say.
I don't know what to do.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Well, why not?
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
Nothing.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
What'll it be?
I'm so sorry, Laura.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I am The Muffin.
Laura, I'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
Bobby killed a guy.
Boating?
Hiking?
We throw away the whole head.
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
I'm sorry, Mom.
Mom, take it easy.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
A special friend?
Oh, I thought I saw you.
How do you know what she doesn't like?
Lay off the bennies, Leo.
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
You're right. There's no one here.
As far as we know, nothing.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
Neither does he. That's where he loses. This man's scared to death to go to court. We only have to call his bluff.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes. It would be.
...yes. Get her on the phone...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth. He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye. You meet him at the hospital.'
Frank Galvin's... who's calling please? Bishop Brophy's office...
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
No.
That's not my handwriting.
You didn't write that figure. And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years?
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
How is that?
How old are you?
I am seventy-four years old.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
Thank you, your Honor. Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a 'Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony. As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
...I was one of a group of...
When she...
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
I completely understand...
I'm going to win this case... Mist... Mr. Doneghy... I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
It was good of you to meet...
...apartment.  No, no. Please. You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
No, you did fine.
No. No. Thank you. You go home.
I am seventy-four years old.
Yes. I wrote it.
Hi. How are you doing?
Who told you that?
Yes.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
I'm an attorney on trial before the bar. Representing my client. My client, do you understand? You open your mouth and you're losing my case for me.
And what are you? A cop?
You just got lucky.  D'you eat yet? Come on.
Is this a bad time.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
That's what I am.
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
No.
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
Pardon?
Yes, we know that you do. I have it in my files. That's at the Manhattan Health Center...
I'll just take a minute. Deborah Ann Kaye. You know what I'm talking about. The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
It's locked?
A healthy young woman goes into the hospital to deliver her third child, she's given the wrong anesthetic...
You know how beautiful she was?  Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
Where is he?
...I'm going to need your help...
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
Mary Rooney. She won't talk to me. I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Give 'em a box of Macanudos.
The Doctors.
...one of the other nurses?
...you need some old forms that she had... somebody's dying...
We got to talk.
I just saw her.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes.
We, we were rather busy...
The Big Boy did...?
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
Me, too.
We'd be in all the papers!
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Yes...ugly looking, isn't it.
It hit sideways and skidded in.
How can you say that when you don't know him!
What's he like?
You never know where you're going to wind up when you go to a square dance!
Can you handle one of these?
Where are we?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I liked him.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
It might give us time to search out some weakness in the Martians.
Looks like the fishing was good.
It's always been a good persuader.
Couldn't you try to communicate with them first - and shoot later if you have to?
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
D.O. to number three..come in.
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
We sell the tamales, enchiladas - hot dogs!
Everything human don't have to look like you and me....
We did.  Bad mistake.  The fans are clamoring for more. So, Evil never dies, right?  Anyway, a while back we got a call from Wes.  He's got this idea.  And who better to resurrect Freddy than his creator?
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
He's very excited about it.
Sort of a trial balloon.
I don't follow.
Like weird calls, by any chance?
More or less.  Dylan, time to get dressed.  I'm late.
Just be careful, okay?
48 hours.  Back before you know it.
Forget those two clowns, Heather.  Answer me, did you get another call from that guy or not?
He was here.  You fell asleep.  We took him.  You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you.  Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him.  Believe me, everything is fine.
What?
You have a fever, sweetie?
What?
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
A story?
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
I don't know why you didn't tell me, that's all.
The way he's writing is so weird, who knows?  I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...?  Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God.  Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
Where's Dylan?!  Have you seen him?
They wouldn't let me...
Robert?  I...
Really!  Listen, Heather, I won't take but a minute of your time.  It's just that we have something to propose to you, and wonder if you'd stop by the offices. Bob'd love to talk to you.
It's time these boys saw some real blue water.
Yep.
I am about this.
Give me some time to blow the man down...
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
Yes sir.
Fifteen.
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
Whatever.
You're not a moron.
Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
It was a bad dream...
Passport?
All stop on the engine.
He's a big boy.
I can take care of myself.
Shut up donut.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
I've seen 'em.  I've seen 'em.
But, they don't speak English.
There are some things that everybody does in the same language.
The first thing is I don't like people talking when I'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
I'm not staying out here.
Joy, rapture...
I don't know...
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
That's not what Skipper thought.  He was trying to spill air from the main!
Well, that's so good to hear, Artie. You know some of us depend on you down this way. You're so entertainin' and you get so many interestin' guests.
Y'all take American Express?
We don't have no paper bags.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
You was in the Marines, huh?
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
Why not?
Have now.
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
You heard from Reggie?
What's gonna happen when he sees me drivin' the car tomorrow?
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Only if necessary, of course, and only in my own country. 
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
What happened on the charges?
Guilty on a reduced charge. Hundred dollar fine and ordered to desist. Pigeons carry diseases and muss up the place. You seen it. Plain filth.
But I'm wild at heart.
If you are truly wild at heart, you'll fight for your dreams... Don't turn away from love, Sailor... Don't turn away from love... Don't turn away from love.
Do you know how it came about that copper wire was invented in Scotland?
The real joke is we never went fishing, but we're still fishing.
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
I guess.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
What was this one?
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
Yeah, I'm here.
You think she's gonna make it?
Let's get outta here, honey.
No radio or TV...
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Oughta make 'em happy.
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
Damn!
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Just a place.
What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.
Take care of him?
Yes... Get rid of him.
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Just tell me what you want.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Simple? Kill him? How?
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
I ain't heard of nothin'.
How are you, Crabtree?
I just mean...
She left me. Crabs.
I'm sure. Where is everyone?
On the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Good God. Let's go rescue him.
Ah. Wait a minute. The university must know where he lives.
Nevertheless. There's a police officer standing on the porch and I don't think he's going away.
My guess -- Vernon Hardapple.
No. But I don't think that matters.
I peeked.
Do you think that's why I've been having these...  ...spells?
Better luck next time.
Relax, Vernon...
No. Sara, you don't understand...
Really? That's remarkable.
So what are you doing out here?
Oh.
Sure.
The guy on the phone.
He wanted to know if a Grady Tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 Ford Galaxie 500 with black interior.
I thought maybe you'd won a radio contest or something. Is that single- spaced?
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
Jesus, James, you should've told someone.
Glaucoma?
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Unless I miss my bet... my wife.
I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
Because of my coat?
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
Okay.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
I'm a little worried, James.
Just checking.
The answer's yes. I think. Yes. I don't know. Where are they exactly?
I hope that isn't true. We need all the downy innocents we can get.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Oh. Well. I...
Uh huh. Well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I'm not the first writer to sip a little weed. And furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book I wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the PEN award which, by the way, I accepted 'under the influence.'
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
Almost. Want to sit up?  What's the matter?
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
I'm kidding. Hello?
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
James Leer.
Of course, I'm sure. Ah, Christ, the puberty police are back.
I know.
I know, but sometimes...
Sure it is.
It's a bathtub. What she's standing under.
Nevertheless, I'd like to see you in my office Monday morning.
I don't know if she'd want me to tell you that, Grady.
A jockey? You mean, like --
No, the dog.
Foreman now.
I just recommended you. You still had to prove yourself.
Mariners are pounding the shit out of the Tigers.
Oh, Anna's. It was great, man. Anna was so pretty.  She looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like Snow White.
Tell Annette I'm busy in July.
Maybe because you're looking her in the face.
Were you watching me?
I have no idea.
Got something to hide?
You can't talk to me like --
Sure they do. But outside they've got trees around them. The trees shade them from the sun. Of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. One of nature's symbiotic relationships.
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
The one with the ax?
Know what?
You could. It'd be a waste of your time, though.
And your new apartment?
Yeah.
You are in.
A long time ago, I was sent far away. When they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
Banished... yeah.
They could be finches. I don't know. We should go before it gets dark.
Yes.
No need to call me doctor. I'm a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
Why not?
Forget it.
I don't need someone else.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
I'm afraid not.
They usually tell me.
Fuck you, Rosen!
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Go home, Walter.
Please don't do it again.
That's not a helpful answer.
What?
Okay. Eyes closed, mind a blank. I'm all yours. Do it, Rosen.
Where are you?
How old are you and your sister?
A nap?
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been there.
I feel... okay.
I'm all right.
It's fucking freezing out here.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
What's weird about that?
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
Yeah, they could.
Yeah?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
You're still here.
No you're not.
It's been a while since...
How many girls did you molest?
The judge had a thing about sex offenders. Later I heard his daughter had been raped. If I hadn't had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
No. Never again.
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
They seduce you?
I'm not scared.
Do what?
I need a shower.
Doesn't mean you had to marry her.
We're being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  Now you know exactly as much as I do.  So just get your gear off and get up to control.  There's some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
Forget it, Sonny.  They're gone.
I'm taking you back out.
Who else?
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
Oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
Do you always have to call him that?  The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick.  His name is Michael.
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
But you think it's something else.  What?  One of ours?
His mixture got screwed up.  He panicked and pranged his regulator.
What do you think he saw?
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
Lindsey!  Wait a second--
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
Deepcore, this is Cab One.  We need assistance, over.  Deepcore, this--
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
Yeah, well you never should have married her then.
Hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
That's it then.  Finler, McWhirter, Dietz, and Perry.  Jesus.
What good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that.  Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
Copy that.
What's the timer set for?
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
We'll send the raft back to you.
But how could you say such a thing?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
You already know what they are.
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
At the ruins. They're very ancient, you know.
And yet, she seemed to feel that our love for her -- mine, yours, even her father's, in a certain sense -- weren't enough for her, or didn't mean much to her.
Oh, Sandro...
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
But why, Claudia?... Why?
Does it please you to say such things?
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
Hurry up now, or it'll begin to get hot outside...
Late, very late.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
To do what?
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet!  Raimondo!
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
It means being without money.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
Who's moving?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
But Corrado...  If something is beautiful why shouldn't one say so?
I was saying... it might even be possible that Anna had left with them.
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
What has everybody got against me this morning?
I know we are. But as the years go by, we become even worse. Isn't that so, Corrado?
But how could they pose like that? I couldn't.
But I want to paint you. You appeal to me more.
And what did they say about me?
And do you remember where she got off?
Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
No, I'm not. Why do you think she does all this? It's one of the many ways she can put herself on display. When you bait the trap, the mouse will snap. To tell you the truth,  if it wasn't for the fact that one hundred thousand lire represents my whole month's salary, well... But you had something you wanted to ask me?
Now listen, if I had any information, I wouldn't have come here to ask you. But I see that you, too, lack any information ...
Is that possible?
You really must do me this one favor.
No.
Why?
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
But she watches... she listens.
Why?
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Say it!
Was it Sister Marguerite?
I don't know.
Anything... may I sit down?
Everyone.
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
He's told you?
You've been alone together?
Where do you meet?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
Where?
I went to my room.
The baby they made up.
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
I... I don't understand.
What do you mean?
No.
Why do you smoke?
No questions.
No... do you?
Why should I?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
How did she know that?
You'll laugh.
Do you?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Why not?  Mmm?
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
I'm always bad.
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Why?
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
Are you intelligent?
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Did you know what was going to come out?
I hate them.
We went to chapel for vespers.
Who?
What did she mean?
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
H... how?
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Marty, what are you doing here?
Something they... that they overlooked.
You're getting to all of us Martha, let's face it.
It's gone on long enough. You're out.
It's Martha, Mama.  There you go.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Yes.
Who told you this?
What business is it of yours..?
Unfiltered.
Yes.
What man had access to her?
Yes, but I...
Why haven't you asked her?
Look, someone gave her the baby.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
That's ridiculous...
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
No... not in the eyes of the police.
Shortly after she came to us.
She stopped eating completely...
She has it now.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
What?
Oh, some time in January.
Earthquakes?
Take at look at it.
Was the child full term?
Your niece!
Oh, dear God.
Why didn't you?  You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
I know you don't.
That's all?  That's enough!  She was a beautiful little girl.
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me?  I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
I'd love one.
Pipe!
Yes I do.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you. 
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
My God, but you're determined.
You wanted that child out of the way.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
We'd be thrown out.
Nine.
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
Read 'em!
Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
Sorry? 
I see you go to the night court.
You never know, you might be lucky this time.
I'll have a bash.
I don't care.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
I beg your pardon?
A butcher?
Wake up!
You crawler.
It's Paul's grandfather.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
I'm not ...
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want ... well ... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Yes.
See you.
Out where?
Oh ... I dunno.
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
A book!
What are they saying?
Every morning.
Who are these ruffians?... I've never seen them before in my life! ... 
Don't dramatise.
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Here, Pauly.
Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
Him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. He's a villain and a right mixer as well.
Don't be callous.
So's mine.
Hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me you're ...
I knew I could rely on you.
You've lost him.
Don't start. Look.
Someone put it on me.
Oh, all right. Come here, Grandad.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
Nerves.
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Oh, him... He's been lurking.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
Well, he can't stop here.
Do you remember the pyramid?
What is it, I can't --
Can you see anything in the hole?
Yeah, but this is hard work.  Can't talk now.
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
Hard to say.
Well, get started.
Yeah, okay.  Go ahead.
Why, what's wrong?
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
I'll come with you.
Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid.  They're from different cultures and different races.  That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did.  The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.
Maybe we can catch it.
Don't be an idiot.
The only other thing I can think of is for somebody to crawl in there and flush it out.
It's time for drastic remedies.
Right.  We've got a lot to accomplish.  Let's get moving.
What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
Just can that crap!  I'm in command here till Chaz returns!  And nobody's leaving this ship!
I think it's fizzled out.
And the creature with it.  We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
We should be almost on top of it.  I just can't quite...
Who knows?
What is it?
How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
I was thinking of a line from an old poem: "Water, water everywhere, but not a drop to drink."  All that space out there, and we're trapped in this ship.
We came out there, we'll go back.  A long time by the clock, but a short time to us.
I can see you're putting your spare time to good use.  Let me tell you something: you keep staring at hyperspace for long enough, they'll be peeling you off a wall.  I've seen it happen.
And you and I will bag it, and then we'll take it to the ventral air lock, got it?
Sandy... how far are we from the source of the transmission?
Found what?
I agree.  This is the single most important discovery in history.
Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
Good.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him.
But if we <u>haven't</u> caught it in a week, then we have to go into the freezers anyway.
What do you think?  Now we go in.
Right now let's keep it closed.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
What did it do to you?
I'll get you out of there.
Too many.
Shit.  When?
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Can we move it to a different orbit in time?
About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
Is it still moving?
How tight are these shafts?
What's the problem?
Punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
What?  Why?
Agreed.
Ah, don't worry about I.C.C.  They're the least of your problems right now.
Give me a yell is something happens.
Yes. The Shubert.
I believe I will.
I hope you mean what you say, Eve. I intend to hold you to it.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
- and artistically, the most promising! Eve dear, this is Addison.
You sat and talked until it was light...
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
I don't know what I take you for anything...
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
... taken it for granted? That you and I...
What of it?
I don't want to make trouble. All I want is a drink.
And too many of them are produced.
I do not. How do you do?
Being violently ill to her tummy.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill?  Lloyd?  Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
It just slipped your mind.
Was she that bad?
I take it she read well.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
This is Eve Harrington.
That's nice.
I'm a junk yard.
Many happy returns of the day...
I'll check with Eve...
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night-  - aren't we, honey?
When I'm guest of honor?
That never stopped you before.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
I can always get a fresh one. Karen - you're a Gibson girl...
Don't mix your metaphors.
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
You've been all through that with Lloyd-
It's not nonsense.
I wish it were.
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
What would you like? Texas?
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine...  ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
Why what?
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
- after all, the other day was one scene, the woods are full of one scene sensations. But you did it. With work and patience, you'll be a fine actress. If that's what you want to be.
From what would I be running?
I'm for it.
Miss Coonan...
See you home...
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
She's loyal and efficient-
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
How do you mean that?
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
What are you doing here?
You were just looking around...
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
Oh, no. I see the play.
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
Not at all.  Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
Not just that way. As a friend...
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
I don't intend to be.
He can help you.
Over my dead body...
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
There are other plays...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me.  As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
I had no idea you knew each other.
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
Ain't it the truth?
Roughly ten minutes.
It doesn't matter.
Well...
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
I can't believe Eve said those things!
Well... all right.
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
It's just possible she didn't...
Five-fifty-five. We'll be at the station in plenty of time...
Eve.
I'm beginning to catch up.
You've got to admit it would be a novelty.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Now just a minute-
Nothing much. She apologized.
I doubt very much that you'd like her in 'The Hairy Ape'.
Not exactly. Sometimes, though, I wish I understood you better.
I will.
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
It's about time the piano realized it has not written the concerto!
That's right, but I don't understand-
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Forget it, the main thing--  --did you call me a failure?
What do you think he meant, this particular incident? Were there others? How would we find out? You know anyone important?
--Hunt doesn't seem like your ordinary consultant.
--a spy, you mean?
--I'm trying--
---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
I never scared anyone before.
--the lookout in the Motor Inn?--  --he say anything we don't know?--
--I haven't said anything--
We're inside the White House now.
--we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.
Same as Magruder, I don't like it when they turn out to be human.
Hmm?
11:30.
The telephone calls... we know about that.
This?  Naw...
Oh, the scuttlebutt for awhile was he was investigating Kennedy--
And you will.  But not now.
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--"I think it might be helpful if you'd send me to Toronto." That was your spiel then. "The Lifestyles of Deserters."  I'm still waiting for it.
--there's nothing new in it--
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
It's obvious you want to talk to someone--well, I'm someone.
Which people?
So tell me about the Times article.
A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis. 
--let me put it this way: I'd have no problem if you did.
The FBI thinks it's possible--the Democrats need a campaign issue, corruption's always a good one.  Get off the story, Ben--or put some people on McGovern's finances; fair is fair, even in our business.
You asking me to disclose my source?
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
Yes, sir.
That checks out with our finding, thank you, Mr. Dahlberg.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Do Justice and the FBI know what we know, and why the hell haven't they done anything about it?
Follow every lead--every lead goes somewhere--
I was being cautious.  You can safely say more then fifty...
We know that--and if we were wrong, we're resigning--were we wrong?
Good God!
--I'm Woodward.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
I would liken your query to being in Russia half a century ago and asking someone, "I understand who Lenin is and Trotsky I got too, but who's this yokel Stalin?"
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
Anyone but Bernstein.
I know, I did, but damnit Howard--  For the first time since I've known him, I think he's really humping...
--go over your sources again--
One Senator just gave a speech slurring us 57 times in 20 minutes.
According to White House personnel, Hunt definitely works there as a consultant for Colson. But when I called the White House Press office, they said he hadn't worked there for three months. Then the P.R. guy said the weirdest thing to me.  "I am convinced that neither Mr. Colson nor anyone else at the White House had any knowledge of, or participation in, this deplorable incident at the Democratic National Committee."
I'm not Miss Abbott.
What the fuck is this?  You got someplace more important to be?
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Onions?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Sure.
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  And this may sound corny, but --
Please.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
You think she was serious?
Right.  That gives us...
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Yeah.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Indeed.  Some fine ladies here, boys. Confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. Sherman is moving to DefCon Two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Do you mind?  This fabric is so uncomfortable.
Well...uh...
Yes, slowly.
I am sorry, Jim.  I suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
Tonight?
Yes!  I'm a shithead!  I'm a complete and total shithead!
Yes --
I didn't say that.  I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
Yeah, are you?
I want to hear you say it.
Yeah.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
What?!  How do I do that?
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
That's the spirit.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
That junior chick?
Nah, gave her the Heisman.  I'm working on something new.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Uhh! Would you die already!
What, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Uh-huh. Good for you.
Andy!
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
What?! He told you? When?
Yeah. French fries...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.  But that would be illegal...
Yeah?
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
I'm telling you. It's not drugs. It's something more. Someth -
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
What did she say?
I was showing Sonya something . . .
Good day!
Yes, your highness.
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
You are the Princess.
The dessert fork!
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
How do you know?
Rodent's intuition, how do I know? She looks exactly like her. Except she's taller, which	is natural ... Of course my second cousin Treplev - he never	grew. Looks like a little pepper shaker. He was so cute ...
No. Empress, you --
I should go
Despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . YES!
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
It's for my brudder.  Alvy Singer! Hey! This is Alvy-
All the good meetings are taken.
I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
Do you feel all right?
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
M'm.
All right. All right. All right.
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
No, Chippewa Falls.
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Well, where is it? I-
You keep it nice.  Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
Yeah, I know.
Okay.
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
what I mean?
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
Oh.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
U-huh.
No, I'm serious.  I just got my mustache wet.
No, I'm not.
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
Do I love you?
No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
M'm, wait, I got a great idea.  Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect.  I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there.  M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Sinatra?
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
I'm following you and David, if you-
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
Yeah, where is the spider?
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
Nothing at all?
Yeah.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Oh, you got a headache!
It's unbelievably trans-plendid! I was at the Stones concert in Altamount when they killed that guy, remember?
What are you depressed about?
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
...as opposed to a print...
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Look, uh...
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
M'hm.
Hi. How do you do.
Di-diabetes? Is that any excuse? Diabetes?
They're persecuted enough!
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
If only I didn't feel guilty asking Annie to move out. It'd probably wreck her. But I should be honest.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Well, hi!
Yeah.
There's a whole wing in this house.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Ten, fifteen minutes ago.
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
You're fucking desperate.
What?
Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life.
You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know.
Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted...
And?
Lucy overdosed.
She's in ICU.
Oh.  You're them.
Oh yeah... I'm gonna save you.
Hey!  Would you?
It was fifteen seconds.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Fantastic.  Out here.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
They're paying him scale.
Just do what I say, alright?
You didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
No.  I missed that.
I mean, you're really back.
And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.  His novels sell millions.
Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum.
Truce?
It's ecstasy, Sal.
He'll find his way back.
Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying.
Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this.
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
That is not true.
Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her?
Don't do this.
He's my favorite.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
No.
Yes I did.
Joking.
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
And I you.
It's Jerry's worst idea.
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
I meant Sally.
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
I'm a little nervous, so...
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
I'll be your best friend.
We're way past inappropriate.
I will treasure this.
That's a lot of those.
Clair is a hovering mother.
Well...wow...
You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan.  They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
Don't go in, Ryan.
Sally?
Do Peter Sellers again.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Yeah.
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
What does that mean?
Why not?
No.  Not something new.
Well, something's wrong.
Relax.  You've done enough.
Evie has a little something for you.
I thought it was okay where it was.
It's much more personal in here.
We're always in here.  She really gets him, doesn't she?
He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
And Cal's this massive adult?
You weren't exactly horrified.
I don't have a drug problem.
We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Right...because every ant's important!
SSHH!!!  SSHH!!!
Climb up that tree and get a better view!
But can there be a society composed of just two ants?
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Is that the same standard you used to choose General Formica?
I've got a <u>name</u>.  It's <u>Z</u>.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Hlllllllp!
Stop fooling around in there.
<u>This is all your fault</u>!!!
Just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, I guess.
A <u>few</u>?
Yes -- but I did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  The wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  Even marriage.  You're lucky -- General Formica is a paragon of anthood.
Our platoon has the best assignment of all.  We're the first into battle!
Don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
Ant Team Six...
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Oh, of course --
Why are we so successful?
I'm glad you asked me that question!
But -- but I've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
Come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  You soldiers get all the glory.  Plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
Poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Ma'am?
You wash 'em, you break 'em. I'll come back for them later.  If he makes trouble, give me a yell.
She's been trying to reach you for the last twenty minutes. They want you up stairs.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
Yeah.  I better not get too close.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Eight-thirty.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
You shouldn't.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway.  I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
Why?
You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
I don't understand --
I'll fix you some coffee.
Who?
What's your friend's name?
They had to pump it out.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
I'm sure that's the explanation.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Gin.
Would you mind opening the window?
I just want some fresh air.
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
A what?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Here.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
Of course not. Here's the fruit cake.  And you want to see my knee? 
Might as well go all the way.
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
In there.
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
All that marching -- tramp, tramp, tramp -- you were having army maneuvers maybe?
What you get from renting to bachelors. All night I didn't sleep ten minutes -- and I'm sure you woke up Dr. Dreyfuss.
I'm warning you, Mr. Baxter -- this is a respectable house, not a honky-tonky.  Come on, Oscar.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
I don't know.
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
Who?
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Thank you, sir.
You know how people talk.
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
I know how it is.
That's impossible.  You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Yes, sir.
Very clever.
What do you mean, sorry?
No key!
I dig.
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
Fran been sick or something?
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
Now will you get out?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
It is?  Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion --  -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
Yeah.  Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Slow down, kid.
How many pills were in that bottle?
Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Sure, Doc.
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Good night.
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
Who?
Get more coffee.
No.
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
I never said goodbye, Fran.
I want you back, Fran.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Remember what we talked about?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
Yeah, we better.
What are you talking about?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
It's a thought.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em --
My part.  Beer, with ice and water.
No -- I worked too far north for LRRP.
We do.
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
No shit.
No -- most of 'em are still standing -- might've been disease.
We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ?
Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ?
Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river.
Too far inland.
I never heard about that.
Ours.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Exactly -- you'll go up the Nung River in a Navy P.B.R. -- appear at Nu Mung Ba as if by accident, re-establish your acquintance with Colonel Kurtz, find out what's happened -- and why. Then terminate his command.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
Do me a favor buddy, please.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
Nobody comes in here.
This gentleman or myself ?
A man of war is never bothered to aid an ally -- you will follow me, Captain.
Of course, Captain -- an unfortunate necessity.
Do you know that jungle?
Lance Johnson? The surfer?
How big it is?
Wh -- what?
Take her in low, Lieutenant.
What's the furthest you been in?
Haiphong.
'Bout a year ago? Is Kurtz still alive?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
I met him.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
The enemy. Who else?
Yes.
Yeah, I like it...
I love it.
Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
I was on threshold of great things.
And you admired him?
Both of us...
Nah.
Yeah, Jesus Christ !
When?
Why?
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Why didn't he shoot you?
And shut up.
I'm not ever goin' to tell you to shut up again.
I should be checking on the boat.
What things?
Did you know -- deeper in the jungle, upriver -- there are savages?
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Needs patching.
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
Question is why they sat here when the storm moved in.  Check their stuff while I sniff around.
Can't be.  Too keen a sense of this place in your pictures.
Where'd you say Eric is?
It's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
Look, why get into this again. As long as it's working, let's leave it alone.  It's been nice so far.  We're together --
That's my line.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
We're not sitting here 'til November.  There's a cargo plane coming to Devil's Cauldron in four days, and I'm putting you on it.
Let's camp.  There's grayling under this ice. I'll snare some for dinner.
You know Meyerling?
Where's my ELT?
Yeah, it is fucked up -- but it's not too late to keep that from happening here.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
No way they'll find you on a five-minute signal.  And no way -more-
The time has passed for men like them and me.  I know it.  But they're still fighting for survival, like cornered animals. That's why they'll kill you. -more-
I'm living proof of that sad fact.
Don't try me.  I'll kill you if it comes to it.
Snowplow, generator, TV dish... hell, we get the goddamn Playboy Channel!  Here, this is for you.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Yeah.  Sorry I barked at you last night.
This miserable wilderness is a state of the union.  Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box.  That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late.  Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.  With a handful of votes you control the greatest frontier since white men stumbled onto the New World.
Cool out.  I ain't about to get blasted.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
Hang on...  Remember that Cessna we saw at the pumping station on the Haul Road?  Belongs to the guy they got patrolling the pipeline.
On a good day I couldn't spare a crosswalk guard.  But now, no way.  Folks're batshit with the weather turning sour.  Bring him in yourself.
This man's friends ain't gonna look favorably on his incarceration.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I want us to go out.
Well, maybe he has nice friends.
Everybody wants that, dear -- it doesn't exit...  Sorry... didn't mean to interrupt.
I'm a waitress.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
No.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
Will you please take it?
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
What's with the dark?
You all set here?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
How ya doing?
No!!! Stay away from me!
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
What you did changed my life.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
It's one idea...
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
I don't.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
So long.
You know what? I...
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I just love her.  How're you doing?
You think you're kidding.
I can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Think white and get serious.
Last word freak.
We will if we can and if we can't, we'll come back and ask you again and again.
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
Well, that's a load off.
No, I didn't.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Get out.
Get out.
Yo, yo, yo...
Never a break. Never.
I love you.
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
Just a second -- he has to go.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Right.
What is this?
Probably.
No fucking way.
Holy shit!  Robert Rath wants to know my name.
We both know what you were doing.
That's right.
Shit.  That sure is a lot of money.
You don't know a fucking thing about me.  You don't have the slightest fucking clue.
Do you want Rath or not?
I'm part of the game, just like you.
He wants to kill you?
Why?
You don't know that -- you're trying to scare me.
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
My first take?
I don't.
Yes.
No.
No.
Sounds pretty well figured out.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
Ten years later, here you are again.
I hate bishops.  They're useless.  I like knights.
How do you know they're not?
Jesus, if someone had --
Thank you.
So I could watch the girl that lived under me.
He told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
It can be.
It happened to you before?
What happened to her?
Was she the only one?
Shit.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
Honesty.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
Some.
Yeah.
I have all day.
But we are underground?
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
Care to elaborate?
Amazing, he didn't even say "if".
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
No....The Asylum!
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
They'll never get us.
So why didn't we?
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
Why don't we go together?
No, We aren't going to do it.
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
It just happened.
WE gotta think of something.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Did you see anything in the files?
I'm not hungry, really.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, pretty well.
Doug?
Really?
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
How about you Brutus?
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
What? You are crazy!
I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
Thanks.
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
How do I know what's being said?
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
No. I won't be long.
I meant he's a doctor.
You do --
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
Ambitious.
The world of the dead?
That is my telescope.
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
The dirty snowball at its core.
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Healthy as can be.
I wanted this to be a date.
We're doing something -- ?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
Away from here.
Look. Talk. Not talk.
The truth. I just left you out of it.
What about your father?
Sure.
No.
What are you going to -- ?
I will.
Nothing.
That I want you to take me home.
That's what I mean.
Yes.
Jamie, he's careless. Reckless.  Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...?
I saw the way he looked at you. The way he kissed you.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
Dad --
Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about.  Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie.
I don't want to see her hurt.
Like what, sir?
Okay. Sure.  My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand.  Made a big impression on him.
How -- how long does she have?
In there.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I thought she built it herself.
Yes. You?
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
I want to come back.
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
Thank you.
Uh, yes, sir...
No....
How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
But he didn't ask me.
Coming, Eileen...
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Look, Marty, I'm just not a fighter...
No, George, just concentrate on the anger. Anger.
Mr. McFly here wants to nuke it all, just so he can see it!
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Well, yeah, I was thinking, if cars are gonna be going two or three hundred miles an hour, they're gonna be using an awful lot of gas. Like, what if we run out?
Operator! Listen, this is an emergency! I have to make this call, but I don't have a dime -- all I got is a nickel -- but you gotta connect me --
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
That's just great!
Hey, look, gimme a break! All I did was answer the door! How's that gonna change history?
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
But why? Why would she do that? She's supposed to marry the guy!
Are you trying to tell me that my mother's got the hots for me?
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
That's just what I needed to hear.
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
Professor Brown grinned. I guess I'll see you in... about 30 years.
No self confidence, I guess... At least you don't take after him.
What do you mean?
Okay.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
Yeah? Why not?
Cause I can't allow it.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
It's okay.
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
I don't know.
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
Yeah.
What?
How bad off is he?
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
I don't blame him.
Yes.
No.
Stay as long as you like.
Just thinking.
Then that's it!
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
They're stealing my chopper!
It's an antidote. A formula.  Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
He went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  The professor told us they threw away the key.
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
She wants a picture.
I look great.  Let's rock 'n' roll.
Sam's dead!  Someone broke into the Jet Car! And things are going haywire over at the lab...
The girl I remind you of.
No, I don't.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Believe in Penny Priddy?
It's Peggy to these eyes.  Same nose, same hair.  Plus Buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
Bet you say that to all the girls, Perfect Tommy.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary  Bill and I are... I love. We-
Barton. I'm sorry, it's Barton Fink.
You wrote his scripts for him?
Before what?
I said drown 'em all! Who is that?
Ever act?
Okay. I'm just having trouble getting started. It's funny, I'm blocked up. I feel like I need some kind of indication of... what's expected 
A souse!
What do you do far a living?
What do you mean, Barton?
What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
Pictures! Jesus!
Yeah, I guess it is. But in a way, that's exactly the point. There's a few people in New York  hopefully our numbers are growing  who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths  not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
Hell, I could tell you some stories
Frequently played, seldom remarked.
Hell no! Jesus, I'm the kind of guy, I'll let you know if I'm bored. I find it all pretty damned interesting. I'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
Well, I can tell you some stories 
Charlie. How are you.
Not a bit of it, compadre! Easiest thing in the world! You just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
Well, my pleasure. I could use a little lift myself.
Well...
No... Can I come in?
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
You didn't let ME down. Or even Lou. We don't live or die by what you scribble, Fink. You let Ben Geisler down. He liked you. Trusted you. And that's why he's gone. Fired.  That guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. He tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. No, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  Anything you write will be the property of Capitol Pictures. And Capitol Pictures will not produce anything you write. Not until you grow up a little. You ain't no writer, Fink  you're a goddamn write-off.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Give you nose bleeds?
How's about it, Bart?
We got a treatment on it yet?
Mr. Lipnik, please 
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
It's been three months.
Don't, Beth.  Don't lie to me.
I don't need any help.
Put your hands up!
What?
Yes.
It won't last.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
No.
To see if I can get away with it.
I know.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
Why?
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
Did you?  What's she doing?
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Nope.  There was some talk; it never panned.
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Thanks.
What are you doing here, Pop?
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  He winks at her.  The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
Ain't that hard, son.  This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  She used Daddy's razor.
He was I.A.  He probably asked her about it.
Fuck you, too Nick.
What about me?
Maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
Let's get out of here.
It's in New Jersey.
Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
You think those are good presents? Who wants an old wig?
You haven't been by lately.
Well, I don't want to get mugged on a Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take my card.
I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
I can get ten.
I'm here.
I hate this. Turn that off.
Yes. What do they... stand for?
What are they?
What?
Yup.
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
SAMO.
I am... On Gina.  Fuck  I didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich.
I ain't John Henry.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Think so?
Hi.
How is he?
That's great.
Stand still.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
What is it you want? Respect? I have respect for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said "Sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." Think about it. Feel it.
Thanks again for not inviting me. I'm only here on business.
I sculpt. I'm really just starting to find myself. How old are you? Twenty? You're just like I used to be. I'm forty-one. And I'm glad I haven't gotten any recognition. It gave me time to develop.
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
I need this?
Uh-oh!
Right.  Sure.  And "Peace on earth, good will toward men."
...four, five.
Maybe you're right.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
Executive Assistant.  Secretary.  Girlfriend?
Nope, I told her everything.
Same here.  So why'd you come tonight?
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
My lips are sealed.
Quiet, Max.  What do you think, this is a conversation?
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
Imagine:  You'll have the ear of the media.  Access to captains of industry.  Unlimited poon- tang ...
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
Well I figured that your password was "Finster."  Your Pomeranian. And it was.  And it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, I mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
I must protect my interests, Ms. Kyle.  And Interest Number One, is <u>moi</u>.
You came to tuck me in.  That's quite a switch.  I am looking for my brother, Wilfred. He is first butler to the Maharajah of Mirajanpore.  But Mirajanpore is a floating court, it travels across India, so Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.
Too late for what, dear child?
Don't be silly, Alfred. After all, she's family.
I've seen the best doctors--! A gentleman does not discuss his health.  It's not civilized.  I hope I've taught you at least that much, young man.
Pamela Isley.  I was so attracted to her I couldn't reason clearly.  I still can't.  She used to work for Wayne Enterprises.  Find a file.
Just don't tell me you're hoping to run away and join the circus.
Why?
I think not.  There'll be no hot time in this old town tonight.  You'll get a charge out of this.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
It's the gear.  Chicks love the gear.
I can make it.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
I guess we'll just have to kill her.
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat.  No coolants to preserve food.  Millions would die of cold and hunger alone.
Maybe your witless playboy persona works on every bimbo du jour but I am not the least bit titillated by your attentions.  So back off or I'll have you in court quicker than you can spell sexual harassment.  Got me?
I wish I knew.
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
You once said to me that being part of a team means trusting your partner.  That sometimes counting on someone else is the only way to win.  DO you remember?
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Fine.  While I retrieve my diamonds, you and meatloaf will bring my wife to your lair.  She's frozen in -
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
Hop away little bunny.  Before I cool your jets.  Permanently.
How about dangerous curves?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
Without your research, I could never have come this far.  Join me.  The two of us, entwined, side by side...
Hardly a worry, sir.
What did you say?
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
My life's an open book. You read?
Maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
Oh please. You're blind as a bat.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
Not much.
Would you? I'm not so sure.
What? This isn't normal?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
But...
Well, I met someone...
He sure did.
They've changed. The dreams, I mean. There's a new element I don't understand. A book. Black. Covered in leather....
Stop fighting.
I don't-.
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
It's Dr. Meridian. Chase. Do you remember me?
...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.
A man with a death wish.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you?
Upstairs. He's quite docile.
What are you talking about?
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Great.  Give me a grant.
You're just back from Corto Maltese.  I saw your combat photos.  Quite a departure for you.
Yeah, a drink. 'Civilized,' right?
No.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
Very thoughtful. Don't touch it.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
WHAT??
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
No shit.  It was all over the pavement.
JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it.
A visual record, yes.  A before-and- after kind of thing.  This could make your reputation.
... Behind the makeup?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
What were you thinking?
Are they paying you for all this?
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
Allie, he's not.
You okay?
Your face smells like a foot.
Thanks, Annie.
Ahm.... .
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
He's just parking the Governor's car.
Exactly.  She's in a surprisingly terrible state.  Isn't she, Bean?
No. no, no, hold on ... We cant sustain our loses - so I've decided.. to sell Whistler's Mother.
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
Not my place, sir.  It would only be a matter of time before I'm calling you Dave.  Then where would we be?  By next year, you're my Sweety-Pie" and I'm "Coochie-Coo".  I'11 be back in 15.
Well, Michael Bolton's pretty grisly.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Well, there is that ...
Bye, Bean.  Thanks for everything. And take care, huh?  I know it's insane, but I'm going to miss you.
Okay.....
NO, seriously - I know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  What do you think it is, Dad?  Jen says it's a moustache, I say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
Of course he is.
What's gone?
Uh,...Oh yeah.
Shut up Beavis! Uh, yeah. We'll do your wife.
Beavis, this is the greatest day of our lives. Huh huh huh.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Heh heh. Yeah.
What a rip-off. Come on. We gotta find that chick.
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Heh hmm heh heh.
Whoa, this is cool! Heh heh. It's like, everything looks all weird and...
Oh yeah,...I mean no. NO! I won't settle down! Not this time!...
Butt-dumpling...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
Um... ass... head...
Yer late.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Uh... No,  I poop too much. Then I get tired.
Ah, the witness?
Deep and hard.
D.C., Chief.
Chief, I swear, we tore that bus apart. They couldn't have...
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
It's so nice to meet young men who are so well mannered.
Muddy! Sonofabitch! Hold it. What's he payin' ya?
You'll be rich!
So do I, Jane.  I'm on vacation.
I will <u>never</u> sell this house. I'll be buried in my yard next to Barbara.  Holding hands!  And a good paintbrush!
You're doing it, Adam.  You're saving this town.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
... Hmmm?
What's she doing here?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
At least we won't have to worry about her.
That's my girl!
Whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
Think of them as death shrouds. And the moaning is important. Really <u>moan</u>!  Practice, practice, practice.
Of course I did.
No, we don't.  We can work something out ourselves.  We just have to try harder.
But he didn't.  We've got him where we want him.
You don't kill anyone.
But... the Deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
No.  What's wrong?
We tried.
I'm so sorry we frightened you. What were you doing?
About what?
It was gross. They wanted me to dissect a frog. I told them no way.  I said it was against my religion.  I got a C.
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  This house is too big.  It really ought to be for a couple with a family.
Where'd they go?
I want to get in.
Can you help <u>me</u>?
He's your cousin.
I think she's in with them.
Stepmother's...
Otho, could you actually... do something with them?
Don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  I'm an <u>artist</u>!  The only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  Do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of Connecticut? Not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Viridian?
Attic space.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
Now, you'll barely feel this. It won't hurt at all.
Yes. I think so, too.
I see.
Thank you.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Thank you, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
A rather large contusion, but I don't feel there is any serious damage. I'd like to keep an eye on him, though - I suggested that he stay here for a couple of days.
I wish he were here...
Of course, Doctor, I understand.
Oh, yes.
Morton Hull, the producer of 'This Evening' just called.
There's no need for a hospital.
I agree.
My name is Chance.
No. I'm a gardener.
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
I like to watch. This is fine.
He does...?
Yes. Are you going to leave and close the house when he dies?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Our greenhouse.
Oh, I like that very much.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
No, thank you.
No, Eve. I like you to be here.
Yes, Eve. I'm very glad that you didn't open.
Yes. It's very good, Eve.
Hello, Sid.
I see.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. I am very hungry.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Thank you, Ben.
Yes. I would like to escort Eve.
A flower...
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes. I like to watch very much.
Yes. I have seen styles on television.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
Yes sir, I guess that's true smallest room in the house.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Yes. I've seen that done.
Yes. It is.
Yes.
Fine, then let's get started. The current state of our country is of vital interest to us all, and I would like to know if you agree with the President's view of the economy?
Well, let me rephrase the question; the President compared the economy of this country to a garden, and stated that after a period of decline a time of growth would naturally follow. Do you go along with this belief?
I live here.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
Ever since I can remember, since I was a child.
Yes, Thomas. I have always been here. I have always worked in the garden.
I was given meals, and a home...
No, I do not have any of those.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Yes. I remember when he came. He was very fat and had short hair and showed me some pictures from a funny little book.
Good. That's good. Then if you would please sign a paper to that effect.
Correct.
... In the garden?
I said - try again.
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
Good evening, Wilson.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Oh. Well, I just talked to Cindy this morning. She loves California, but to quote her, she says, 'The Secret Service is getting to be a drag.' I guess she wants her privacy...
Well, I think Jack needs some time alone with you, darling... He's getting to that age, you know... He really misses you...
I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple... In a way, he's quite charming...
I said good night!
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
Right, Chief.
What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman?
Good. Anything else?
Yes, chief - eight other foreign powers have put Gardiner under surveillance. We're around-the clock now, sir - I'll keep you posted.
That is correct, Comrade Skrapinov. We have ascertained that Gardiner heads a big-business power group that will soon be taking over the American government.
Well, I'm delighted to be here, my friend. I've missed you.  Here, sit down, get off your feet.
Well, Ben... I...
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Okay.
Yeah.
Please, have a seat.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
May 11th.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We have to make it an early night.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
'kay.
Now?
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You've always hated the animals.
Fuck Maxine.
And he was with her.
Me and John.
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
I know.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
My name is Schwartz.
Forget it.
You suggest what? I have no time for piddling suggestions from mumbling job applicants, my good man. Besides, Dr. Lester will see you now. I think that's what he said.
Music to my ears! Whatever you said. Speak, speak, speak, my magnificent friend, speak!
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
Yessir.
Is that true?
I wouldn't know.
No, really.
Who told you?
The usual, Barry.
Please, let me explain.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings and a halo.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
Vegas? What'd you think?
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
Let her go, Craig. I mean him."
I love you, Lotte.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
There ain't.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
You saying God give up? Nothing left for us but pour out our own blood?
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
You don't sit with me!! I don't sit with people who leave me!
Not for me, you don't! You don't let me eat the pies...
Yes?
I don't. I have my own.
You grown.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
Yes ma'am.
I miss her.
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
Hold back Denver - I'm fine..You..you go on upstairs. I'll do the cleaning up.
Was over to Baby Suggs.
I know Denver.
True.
That's so.
I come looking for you to ask your pardon. Apologize.
Oh yeah. I got big plans.
She ain't crazy. She love those children. She was trying to outhurt the hurter's all.
Yeah. Look bad?
You got to get up from here, girl.
Look - Denver be here in the day. I be here in the night. I'm a take care of you, you hear? Starting now.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Oh, nothin', you know.
Her life is in your hands, Dude. And report back to us as soon as it's done.
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back.
Fuck you.
Yes.  I understand you're taking away the remains.
We have the urn.
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Huh?
That's fucking exactly what happened, Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!
Saturday!  Well they'll have to reschedule.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Where's your car, Dude?
Lebowski on the right?
And in fact he met privately with the President, though unfortunately there wasn't time for a photo opportunity.
I guess he's pretty, uh, racially pretty cool--
Yes, heh--
Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple of Creedence tapes.  And there was a, uh. . . my briefcase.
Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my papers.  Business papers.
...Also, my rug was stolen.
Of course you do.  I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point. Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career
Yeah, but what about--
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
She most certainly was not!
Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?
Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.
Huh?  No, really, I don't even have the bruise any more, I--
Delayed after-eff--
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed of Sound Tour.
What do you do for fun?
It's a complicated case, Maude. Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately I've been adhering to a pretty strict, uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, you know, limber.  I'm real fucking close to your father's money, real fucking close.  It's just--
We did let Father run one of the companies, briefly, but he didn't do very well at it.
He helps administer the charities now, and I give him a reasonable allowance.  He has no money of his own.  I know how he likes to present himself; Father's weakness is vanity. Hence the slut.
Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you talking--I'm not--we're talking about unchecked aggression here--
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Hey man--
Am I wrong!
They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was in our hands!
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
Okay Dude.  Have it your way.
Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact that you're a goddamn moron.
Uzi?
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
Nihilists!  Jesus.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Uh-huh.
And the fucking money.  And we know that this is your homework, Larry.
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
Okay, but how does all this add up to an emergency?
Walter, come off it.  You're not even fucking Jewish, you're--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
Yeah, and you were--
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
This driveway.
Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS! ACHTUNG, BABY!!
Yeah.
Come on, Walter!.
You're a fuck, Walter!
Shit!
--so, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
Well no, like I said, Woo peed on the rug--
Dude.
Strong men also cry. . . Strong men also cry.
I--the royal we, you know, the editorial--I dropped off the money, exactly as per--Look, I've got certain information, certain things have come to light, and uh, has it ever occurred to you, man, that given the nature of all this new shit, that, uh, instead of running around blaming me, that this whole thing might just be, not, you know, not just such a simple, but uh--you know?
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
He's half yours, partner.
I'll heal.
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
For what?
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Where the hell have you been?
Why don't you ask your girlfriend?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
So?
He was here.  Watching us.
Ain't no thing but a chicken wing, buttercup.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Look, what's your problem?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
Blade doesn't talk about the old days much.
China Town. I need more serum.  What's all this?
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
Who is LaMagra?
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
Because they're vampire wanna-bes. If they're loyal, if they prove themselves, then their masters will turn them.
What do you see here?
Graffiti --
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
I don't know. I woke up just before you did --
I'm not leaving without you.
You don't understand. The Thirst --
I was in the neighborhood.
Deacon brought me back.
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
The Blood Tide. Our long-prophesied holy war against the humans. There's a force, you see -- a spirit that exists in our blood. I've discovered a way to invoke it.
What makes you think we want to be cured? Blood is only part of the equation. The hunt, the killing, that's what the Thirst is really about.
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
My name is Abraham Whistler.  This is Blade. As for our little homunculus here --
You think I'd let him run loose without a chaperone? Blade ferrets their rat-holes out, I map them. Then we blow them all to kingdom come.
Go on, I'll be fine!
I didn't. He was cruel enough to let me live.  Even gave me a souvenir to remember him by.
Then we're back to square one, aren't we? Sooner or later, the Thirst always wins.
Join the club.
I don't...I don't understand them myself.
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
Trying to find the energy.
Sometimes. Where are we going?
Something was wrong.
Mrs. Leavitt--
--he's not my husband!
Down or off--you're giving me a migraine.
--but she was nicer then--sweeter-- she hadn't vomited twice already like today--
I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
It's like traveling back in time.
What?
--whatever; that's her.
It's a <u>sketch</u>, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
You don't want it though.
We've looked at half of one tape.
--bullshit!
Whatever you want.
The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--
<u>Before</u> 5:00--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
--yeah, the goddamn stoners! Who you think stole the stuff!?
I don't know yet.
Something. Someone.
--fuckin' A right--
--and unlike the first one, every second of it's gonna be true! "Blair Witch: The Real Story!"
--I don't know.
--turn the camera off--
--Graduate Thesis--
I am.
I'm not finished.
Right. And the check's in the mail.
Due for a re-load and battery check. I'll get on it.
--I dunno, I just woke up--
Ah, Domini?
What'd you say?
Get some more beer.
Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
There was an accident early this morning. Another car. Your father's injuries were fatal.
I'll tell your mother not to expect you at the funeral.
I am?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Door's locked. Nothing there.
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
What'd he say?
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
I don't know. It's early... I love you.
Yeah...
In the trunk.
I think someone's watching.
Christ, I'm getting bored.
Channels, we got two and six. Two don't come in so hot.
What?
No.
Yeah.
I didn't say that.  Well?
I want you to go fishing.
So it would seem.
Right. Sorry.
Where?  ...I'm very careful about that.
Kind of a bleak point of view there, isn't it Marty?
For what?
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Oh yeah?. Have you seen any?
Aunt Barbara. I love you, but you're not gonna get it.
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Hi. Hi Sandy. I'm sorry to bother you, but I've got to talk to you.
Who knows you have these?
Not yet.
Then, shut up!
Those are my breasts.
If you want to.
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
Jeffrey.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
An experiment? Hey, I've seen you before.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
The phone. What did you hear on the phone . Tell me. Word for word.
Sure I'm alright. 
See my breasts?  . See?
Did I say that?. I didn't mean it. or did I?  Sometimes I think it would be fun.  Go ahead, you better leave now. I can't open myself to you now. I'll tell you a little secret.  I want to die.
Yeah. hurry up though.
Who's it, you mean.
No. I should go.
Kiss me.
No. not really.  but also because I really want you to be alright.
Who, Dorothy?
Don. help him. HELP HIM!! DONNY!!!!
Okay Frank.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
You really do hear a lot, don't you?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
Now, how are you going to do that?
O.K.
I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
What did you see?
No way. I'm about to blow up.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Yeah, but. I don't think it's going to do much good. Let's go. I'll try to talk to him later.
Oh yeah?
Jeffrey!!
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay. great!
It's good to see you.
No.
Jeffrey. honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
What?
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Nothing. I'm fine.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Say "goodnight" to Sandy.
Ha ha.  That's too much, Georgie.  Those days are over.  The rate is one-thousand dollars.  Inflation, you know?
Derek!
No, not at all.  Sure.  You're right. You fly home and get some rest.
Baby, you didn't have to come.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
It's garbage.
Yes, I am.
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
What are we doing here, Diego?  This guy's a clown.  He's talking about clothes.
Excuse me?
We're not cops.  We're from Massachusettes.  I mean, does he look like a cop?
It's your grass.
For calling you a homo.
No fucking way.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Oh my G-d.
Fifteen hundred.  We'll have to stop somewhere to refuel.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
It is bad.  It's chump change.  We might as well be hauling suitcases across the border.  We're getting screwed.
Well, you better get here fast.  I'm sitting on...
We're half a million off.
You're a lucky man, Diego.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
Barbara.
I've seen those in magazines.  They're not cheap.
But, never mind.  I am thinking we can do much together.  This problem with Diego, the stolen car, the jail, is very silly business.  To release him from the carcel, it causes me much inconvenience. The fifty kilos could have been a big problem.  And I don't like problems.
I want money.
Keep them coming.
Yeah, well...
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
Don't bullshit me, George.  I don't see you very much, I don't want to waste the time.
You know how we were wondering what we were going to do for money?  Being how we don't want to get jobs and whatnot? Well, check this out.
The set-up is wrong.  We're doing all the legwork, and at the end of the day, we're still paying retail.  We're getting middled.
He's getting middled, too.  And Derek's our partner.  What's good for us is good for him.
Do I know you?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Pablo said no.  It's all over.  And I'm never going back.  I have you.  We have the baby.  And there's nothing else. It's just the family now.  Shhh.  Sleep now.
What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
She's getting big.  Getting her own ideas.
Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Better than you.
Are we gonna split up?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Okay, George.
Let the record state the witness has identified, Diego Delgado.
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
When there's something to move, it's too easy not to.  Do you know how many colleges are in a twenty mile radius? U. Mass, Amherst, B.U....
Right.  And Holyoke.  There are a hundred thousand rich kids with their parents' money to spend, but there's never anything available.  Nothing good, anyway.  I'm paying four hundred dollars for shit.
Don't be such a pussy.
Third group. What's your assignment?
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
It's true.
Even that could be a trick. You escape, then show up at the address which the brothers in prison gave to you, and so you are able to contact me ...
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
Then don't complain.
Not enough.
Yes, but we must also show them that we still exist.
I think it'll be a success ...
Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
Why?
I don't know.
Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever argue?
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
I'll rephrase the question.  Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Rebecca Lawson.
You wouldn't know her address, would you?
What did Mr. Marsh say?
How would you describe your sex life with Miss Lawson?
And how are you now?
Why do you think she left you?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What did she say?
We stopped seeing each other.
Why?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
-- And what did you suggest?
No.
No.  No, I don't.
No.
Yes.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
He video taped you.
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Yes.
There's an item you picked up that's marked.  Will you read it?
A.M -- or P.M.?
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Why'd you come here?
I'll have you out in a few hours.
We're not animals.
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
It's not my taste.
Hi, Frank.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
What?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
No.
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
I don't know.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
Aw, Betty.
Well, I'd like to read them.
Was this during Betty?
Did we want to?
Not this kind of heat.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Want another cigarette?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
No, your kids.
Much.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
You get used to it.
Do you want to leave your husband?
Okay. See you later.
How about if I set the table?
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
Nobody's asking you to.
What were your parents like?
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
What do you want me to say?
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
Yes. And I've accepted.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Now?!  It's after eleven.
Frannie.
It's only four days.
Hmm. How about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
What's she like?
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
WHAT!
I know damn well she's there.
Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Go for it.
I'm telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
Bones.
Ain't no big thang.  It's just a po' man's free base.  Here, check it out.
Go on.  It won't kill you.
Let me see your hand.
No.  Not...not you.  You I forgive.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
But.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
You said the vision, the images.  They're just that.  Just pictures.  They can't hurt you.  That's what you always said.
You moved into this block?
I manage them.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
Back here.  At the end of the block.
Dead?  I don't think your past is dead.  It's alive.  And it bites.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
That's it.  Get out.  Now!
Last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
Shit, that was fast.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
But --
No more thoughts from your asses.  Or I will burn your asses and snort the ashes. Hear me?
Get that car the hell away from here, now!  I spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  But this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
The blood is still there.  We just gotta figure out where.
Admit what?
Caesar, I don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
Yeah, I know.
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
Stay away!
All part of the business.
I'm sorry, Christ, I thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels.
What are you talking about?
What are you, drunk?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
No.
Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out.
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
Just hurry.
Shut up, Violet!
Not until he has the money!
You need the money just like we do.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
Pretty good, sir.
No.  Rajeev's in India.
Five.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
I could be lying.
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Fuck it, I don't need the key.
How do I know you are cops?
You did the right thing.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
He said you lost something.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
Tell me about it.
What?
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  She was always more honest than me.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
I think so, too.
Even though he knew about you?
That's what he told himself.  But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar.  He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are.  I understand them.
How much money?
Then what?  Exactly.
Does the case lock?
Why?
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
What if he doesn't run?
Hey, Johnnie ...
We're talking about Marseille. We're talking about Nykwana Wombosi. And I'm asking you if this abortion in Marseille has anything to do with Treadstone.  Was this Treadstone?
Yes.
Then I'd have to explain Treadstone. And you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  Doesn't sound like much of a Plan-B, does it?  We'll clean up the field.  You clean up your budgets.
I'm not asking.
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
What do you want to do?
We're in the shitter, man!  Pick your poison.  Maybe he's in there to finish the job.  Maybe he's working for Wombosi.  Maybe they want to go on TV together.  Every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
...which one are you?...
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
So it's time to go home.
I don't think so.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
One moment, sir.
You are a friend of his?
Yes.
We just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. Gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  I think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as I said, a bit more competitive.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
You don't want the police any more than I do.
Well, this is great.  I'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
There was a gun.  Who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
No.  No.  Go around.  Keep going...
Thanks for the ride.
You got me pretty fucking curious.
All this stuff -- it's all about boats.  I think I'm in the shipping business.
-- just --
He went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
It's a company... MPG Capital.
Nykwana Wombosi. 
-- I paid this fucking guy -- I paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- I told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- Mr. Thomas.  I told Mr. Thomas I didn't know this guy was already married -- I admitted this!
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
So now you're asking for a student visa?
Where am I?
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
I won't forget this.
I fixed it myself.
Tuttle! ... mumble!  You've had that scab Tuttle here, haven't you?
What? How do you know my name?
Jill Layton ...  You're a very good little girl. What are you doing here?
- In fact, killing people - they'd get a lot more out of life.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
That's all right Mr Helpmann. Glad to help.
I understand, Sam, I know exactly how you feel. So I brought you a bottle of barley water.
You sound worried.
Sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - Records is a dead end department, no Security Level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed -
Terrific. I'm really glad you dropped by. Unfortunately, I don't have any time right now I've got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why don't we have a drink tonight?
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
OK. Come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. If you give me the number of the case, I'll have the dossier here waiting.  My tailor,... well worth the investment.
What is it?
He's a freelance subversive?
Out of kindness.
What does that mean? I don't want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
And you're mine.
Do you know what you're doing.
Trust me.
I do. Goodbye. 
Jack ...
Please!
Where are you taking me?
Things would be worse without Information Retrieval.
Who will?
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
We? Don't blame me!
What?
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Take care.
Oh my God, a mistake!
Yes.
Yes.
Oh - yes. Look you're putting me off, standing there! Go back to your office and I'll give you a knock when I've finished.
How long will she he away?
Don't be childish, Samuel. Of course you want something. You must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
Not now ... please
This is an emergency!
Hello. Mr Lowry?
No need, sir
What if there is no tomorrow?
Two years. Ever since we left island.
No underwear?
Dead.
That's too bad. Get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. Some kid I wouldn't let wash my Mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. Damn, I thought I could make it onto the balcony like Tiger. He's fat, that's why, falls faster. I'm trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. Am I shot, Frank?
I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
He's going to be all right, right?
No way, man.
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
You never know.
At least he's got people around him.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
How is she?
Okay.
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
You married?
Ah, no. I was.  It's hard to explain. She had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
Okay.
You asked me not to come.
No, the city doesn't discriminate. It gets everybody.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Thanks.
It's coming.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
You can't leave me now.
That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
I'm sorry.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
Let's get in a fight, then.
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
That's ridiculous.
You learn that in the army?
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
I'm not hungry.
You know what. The radio.
He's drunk.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
There are only ten.
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
What's wrong with it?
Nothing.  I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
What?
I'll find some copy.  Be right back.
Can I ask you something?  You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Are you any closer to a decision?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
I don't like the word gay.
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Good night.
We can cut back at the end.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better.  That's why.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
No.
Then it went well.
No.
Then what was good about it?
I'm not kidding.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Outside?
No.
What is she shooting?
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
Almost immediately.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
Well, the visual with the boots at the end was just perfect.
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
Yes, there is.
I'll never tell.
We could...
Should I...
Bobbie, please.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
No.  Really...don't worry about it.
Would it help if I got you a tutor?
It's not opinion.
I was a lot earlier.
I don't write.
Yes.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
Billion.
Excited.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
What?
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Uh-huh.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
I'd be glad to help.  For $50 an hour.
I didn't finish talking to you!
What did he do?
Hm...
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Do you have to be so cold to him?
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Let's check out the scene.
Well do some looking around the room. I see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
Enough already about it - get to work!
OK...good night Mr. De Santis!
These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Put it down, Walter.
What offers have you got for it? I won't be out-bidded.  I'm a wealthy man and I don't mind paying for something I want.
Chasing the dragon?  Whaddya mean?  You sure you don't want a pancake?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
Smack?
Good ol' mild mannered Walter! Give it up.  It doesn't fly with me.
Turn around!
Relax!
Well I'm overjoyed.
I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 
Yes, get rid of them...
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Why not?
What do you get?
Then let me give you something then...
Let it inspire you.  Maybe it will let you think of me.
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
I had him in my grasp.
Litter, yeah!
Well, there it is, isn't it?  You don't even like them, and you'd sleep with them.  What's that all about?
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  Hundreds of beans.
I'm fine.
Get away from here.
I mean it.
Yeah, I saw her.  Bitch took my wheels.
Hi, guys.
Nothing.  It was just a dream.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
You broke up with my machine?
No...
It could happen.
Buffy.
They were vampires, weren't they?
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Where are you gonna go?
I know.  My guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'Prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
I think I could help.  You gonna tell me you don't need help?
I'm going to the senior dance.
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
Get away from me!
) What do you think?
Oh my God you're having an affair.
You look way pretty, Kim.
I'm looking for you, actually.
I've searched the entire world for you, Buffy.
This is it.
All right.  What do we do now?
I have cheerleading squad.
It's true.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
Well... I do cheerleading now. It's way cooler.
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
I don't want to be the chosen one, okay?  I don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  I just want to graduate from high school, go to Europe, marry Charlie Sheen and die.  It may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but I think it's swell.  And then you come along...  and... and then I'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
I can't work this.
We call them zippers.  They're not supposed to be a challenge.
I was just scared is all.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
B'bye.
So very much.
Make me a woman!  Yes!  Make me a woman!
No --
But --
Nee sitch.  No way.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
As long as there's room for three in it.  What, didn't you bring your new friends?
I am.
Run.
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
Switch nostrils?
Nuke?!
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
He' s confused--
Aren't we all?
Who?
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
What's it say?
You need a nickname.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
C'mon, God damn it, gimme some!
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"?  This guy's a first ball fastball hitter.  He's looking for heat.
A gift.  When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
Yep.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
Go for it.
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
Don't try me.
Ain't he warning up?
You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes--  We want you to mature the kid.
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
I'm getting too old for this game.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
Okay...
Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.
That's right.
I never comped you?! I don't comp you at least two or three times a month at the Tangiers?!
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
He's lying.
Was I at that dinner?
Philip, if you would rise.
It's a pity in this...
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying.
The worst was Blue.
That's right.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Well...
Help, Daddy!
Mommy.
Oh, no, please, please.
I don't know.
Place the checks properly. That's the way you do it.
Somethin', huh?
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?
I don't wanna be involved in anything you're talkin' about...
...uh, uh, cigarette holder. I'm - I lost control?!
You know, I didn't want to bring this up, but you have treating a lot of people with a lot of disrespect. Even your own wife.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
Listen, I would -
Hey, she came to talk...
I knew what he wanted, and I didn't want any part of it.
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I didn't do anything. I mean, I didn't order you or anybody...  I only told Andy Stone that you had a lot of heat on you, and that was a problem.
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
What are you -
Me?! I wouldn't even be in this situation if it wasn't for you. You brought down so much fuckin' heat on me. I mean, every time I meet somebody here, the big question is do I know you.
Get this through your head, you Jew motherfucker, you. You only exist out here because of me!  That's the only reason!  Without me, you, personally, every fuckin' wiseguy skell [Skell: the lowest form of wiseguy - a drunken bum] around'll take a piece of your fuckin' Jew ass! Then where you gonna go?!  You're fuckin' warned! Don't ever go over my fuckin' head again! You motherfucker, you!
I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you.
And what'd she want?
I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
It's me.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Yeah? Nicky, I want to talk to that fuckin' bitch.
No, that's quite all right.
I'm sorry, but he knew about our gettin' hit on three big machines in a row and he did nothing about it. That means either he was in on it or, forgive me for saying this, he was too dumb to see what was going on. Either way, I cannot have a man like that workin' here.
No problem.  Sorry.
And they were usually right.
All right, we're clear.
I-I'm sorry, Sam.
What can I do?
No, Ace.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
I...
She could at least lose half a pound or a quarter.  Listen...
I-I'll do it.
Okay. 
That was all bullshit. She just pocketed the cash.
Thanks a lot.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
Yeah, I know all that.
You do whatever you want. Do I keep my promises, or do I keep my promises?
The only thing is... you shouldn't keep this in the house. We gotta put it in a bank.
Now look,  pay attention to me. What I'm gonna tell you is very important.
But as much as they loved her...
Oh, fabulous.
Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean...
Good, so then you could tell me what the money is for.
What?
Yes, I - yes, I do.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes.
...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes.
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
She had the same.
...you out of your mind? That's our child. Are you out of your fuckin' mind?
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Don't you threaten me!
Not gonna let me in?
In a  Wild and unprecedented outburst that followed his gaming license  denial, Rothstein followed several...
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front.
I really think you're -
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
You're firin' me?
This is not the way to treat people.
I mean, if I can't work in Vegas, where am I gonna go?
Can you do it with your left hand?
Yeah, that's my pen. Why?
You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off?
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here?
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
Yeah, least you could do is return my phone calls, though.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
I understand.
Tell him to go fuck himself? You fuckin' hick!  Fuckin'...
Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game.
Now go out there and show your dad what you can do.
You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does.
He tries to do everything...
I know.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Are you sure?
Yeah, I know. That's why I'm asking. You see, my main concern is Nicky.
T'aggia parla. [Italian-American slang for 'I've got to talk to you'] Nicky... See that guy? 
I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
You did. You're right.
Yes, you did.
How the fuck am I gonna get your fuckin' money now? You think he's gonna give you fuckin' money? Are you out of your mind?!  Look what you just did to this fuckin' guy! If you would have just kept your fuckin' mouth shut!  Ah, what the fuck is the use? I should've never got invol-
I told you I was hot tonight.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Where are you goin'? Where are you? You're in that place. Where are you?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
She started it. She started the whole thing. I'm just standin' here.
Yeah.
Come here, come here.
She asleep?
Every night, on the couch.
Yeah?
I don't trust him anymore. But they'd never okay anything, you know?
What?
Take it easy!
No, no, no, no!
Well, I'm a little confused here.
Mr. Chairman -
Oh, sorry -
What's the matter with you?
I'm sorry.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
Take it easy, though.
Having a good time?
Oops--my face must match my cape. And to think we were going to let you go...
No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
So, did you see "Seinfeld" last week? That Kramer-guy really makes me laugh.
No it's not.
Well, it's just that I would think that the woman who is the real, non- imitation Catwoman would be pretty angry at some little amateur minx stealing the whole whip idea. Really angry.
I got home fine. How's the "warehouse."
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
A bit on the suspicious side, don't you think?
I suppose she does.
Yes, did you call us here for any particular reason?
I know, I know, a Warrior. You're very annoying..Now tell me how to defuse the bomb you've set..
Resting Up?  Sorry Spooky, I've got to go with God on this one. I hate to think we're just in this for the money.  Garfield's girlfriend crossed a line last night and she's got to get spayed. We're going out of Oasisburg on a win.
Well. I stand corrected.
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
What did you say?
Absolutely.
What's the matter with you, Spooky, my most trusted comrade?  We are warriors!  These are the challenges we live for!
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
I'm not through. This will come as a shock. Again, to one of you. I am Catwoman. The Catwoman.
Fine, fine, at a later date, I'll be more than happy to talk about my perverse psychological complexities with the one who's not the creep. But for now, I'm drilling inside your brains...I bring up the whole Catwoman thing for one reason.  I bit Captain God in the hand and the next day you both show up equipped with big bandaids and wobbly excuses--  "My grandfather is inventing a new kind of blender.."
Okay, deal.
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
Yes, you do. You have to go rescue all those people...
We met on the Internet. The Captain put out a cryptic message calling for a new order of crimefighters. We don't even know each other's true identities...
I would appreciate a little space. Thank you.
Don't you have children?
Taking messages.
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
Oh.  Seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
I'm trying to help somebody. Okay?
I'm not finished.  Under other circumstances I'd gladly go out of my way.  I don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Only I was sloppy.  I let you take me out.  That was quite a humiliation.
Mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Allow me.
Any minute.
Who smashed the phone?
You're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- I do not care.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Stop throwing names at me.
26th off Wilshire.
Our house always needs touching up.
Shit, stop with the money!  I never asked for a nickel.  I was just doing this.  And you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
I can hear you again, clearly.
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
The one in Brentwood.
What bank?
What do you mean?
I'm pretty good at signatures myself.
Jack hasn't loved me for years. And now I'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  So cold and distant.  I've let him make her like that.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
All right.  Now that you explain it I see that you're right.
Just start walking.  Come on. Walk to me.
Somehow I got along better with you on the phone.  It's all there isn't it?
He seems to think he's entitled to it all.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
You're enjoying this too much.
Yes I would.  Not kill you.  But blow off a few toes, absolutely. I'm entitled to that as retribution.  It'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. They must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
I can't hear.  Now there's a siren.  They must be in an ambulance.  What about the money?  Nels?
How about "later?"
That's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. I must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
-- The phones, Theo.  Don't leave any of them behind.  The cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
Keep talking.
Pass.
Got a phone in that van?
Fucking "A" it is!  Any argument and I'm out of here.
Then just wait.  I'm counting this all out and deducting my share. While I'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  And her little girl.
Negative.
She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
There's two police cars now.
In your dreams.
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  In which case you just warned them.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Something was rattling around. Some loose tools.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
Who the fuck you kidding?  Send me money!
Is that good or bad?
Then why doesn't she?
When a girl runs out like that, she generally wants to be followed.
No. Tell him to go fuck himself.
It's him, isn't it?
Fuck off, Dave.
What?
Off his wages.
Guy I work with.
Not you. How quaint. How old-fashioned and quaint. Isn't it, Col?
You know.
As different as it's possible to be.
Didn't think I could.
I am.
Want to look after you.
Yeah.
I'm superstitious. Drink.
Why?
Apologies, my sweet.
Ask me to meet you again, Jimmy.
How?
Can't help it, Jimmy. A girl has her feelings.
Kind of wish I didn't.
A little.
You gonna tell me why?
No.
Not here.
Why shouldn't I be jealous?
She from Scotland too?
You could say that.
What?
My pills...
Don't go like that.
Died...
In a manner of speaking.
Try and go, then.
I like you, Dil --
Love you, Dil.
Tell me what she wore.
You will, Dil
Meet Col --
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Horny bastard.
Did you give him it?
Leave me alone, Jude.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
You know what. Go.
And what if you don't?
You may be right.
You're on duty. Keep your fucking mouth shut. Go in and get some sleep.
Good. I was beginning to have my doubts about you for the last few days.
Should blow you away, you know that?
I understand.
Right.
Can't eat through a canvas bag.
You trying to hurt my feelings?
You're going to have to do it, aren't you?
You want to bet?
I'm talking about your people, not you.
She's not my type.
Don't be so sure.
Like what?
Who's Dil?
Oh, yeah.
You liked her?
I don't know her.
What?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
No.
Stop that talk now --
I said you bastard -- stop --
Hurling --
Hurling --
You never know.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
It was fun while it lasted.
You shut your face --
Give me the fucking shooter!
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Where's that airlines bag?
Lord, you're stubborn.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
Then who did? You're the only one left.
You lied to me so many times --
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
No thanks.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
Very sweet.
Ours.
Oh, I see.
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
Agents.
No, what?
That's not Carson Dyle.
Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
Around one.
But you're -- divorced?
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
Me?
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide?  Then I take it there are no objections.
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it?  Aren't you going to tell me?  Hello -- ?
I met a man with sharp nails.
I left him hanging around the American Express.
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Yes, but we're divorced.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Cutting it out.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
Who?
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
No -- not yet.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Well!
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
Do you have anything to eat?  And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
And the last one?
What do you want?
She isn't going to be anybody's mother unless you answer some questions.
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
I wish you wouldn't.
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Okay.
Peter Joshua.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Shakespeare never said that.
Thank you.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
What was it?
How about once more around the park?
How would you like a spanking?
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
Oh la vache!
What's the matter, chérie?
Don't be un-neighborly-like, Herman -- don't forget he done us a little ol' favor.
He took care of Charlie for us.
I think I know how to restore your reputation.
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
As fucking if.
So?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
is there anything you do?
Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
What's wrong?
I have a question to ask you. A personal question.
No honey.
I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
What did you hear?
Run!
I like the idea of all the kids in one place. If it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I'll be back in a couple of hours.
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
I'm sure you should have failed.
My house is just a couple of blocks away. Why don't you come on over and clean those cuts up.
You know about that too?
You're so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
Why?
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
Nobody wants to be the fourth. Please go with me.
You know I want to go with you.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
Yes!
Jody, you're only doing this to get back at your dad. It doesn't have that much to do with me.
I love you.
Hi princess.
Yes?
That's what he said.
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
You didn't believe her?
EVERYONE JUST KIND OF LOOKED THE OTHER WAY.
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
So are you.
Yeah. I'm extremely worried about that. It's right up there with global warming.
That wasn't me ...
ROD!
INT. ICE CREAM TRUCK/CAB - DAWN.
...that is going to explode...
INT. GOMEZ'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
Where's Sam?
Uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  And we need that in cash.

Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
Yeah, I believe him.  He was my friend.
You are not takin' my truck!

No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
I didn't steal the truck! He owed it to me!  Anyway, the important thing is I'm not goin' through Missoula!
 Shut up.
Fine. 
Okay, okay! 

Doesn't work.
Oh...
...gun?!
You wanna hit me?
And I'm a peaceful man, and...
It was owed to me.  You stole the damn...
Oh!
...up!
Come on, old...
I think...
Oh, shit.
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
 Oh...
Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!

No.  Shit.
Come on.
Okay.  All right.  Okay. 
Then stay...
Oh, shit.
Oh, no!
Oh, no!


Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
We were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  I was drivin'.
Well, shit.  Could be worse.  I mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
...loaded, I didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
No. 
What?
 Okay.
...-natic.


Oh, shit.
...our ass!
Tunnel.
Whoo!
What do you think I'm doin'?!
 
What?
We got-...

...another way  outta here.    Hey.

...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
...about him.
...frozen!  So if you don't mind--!
...without compunction.
Well, well, well.
But...
...take my sorry old truck.
 ...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
...-lem too?
No, sir.  I've never seen this guy before.

No, sir.
If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...
I don't work for you, Captain Brynner.
...-ple.
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
And let me guess.  You failed.
Good to see you again, Leo.
Pleasant surprise.
I checked your release date.  I never liked coincidences.
...-enworth.  I'll have no compunction at all about using this.
...here!
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
INT. POSTAL VAN - DAY.
INT. VITELLI'S HELICOPTER - DAY.
No.  A pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  I almost remember what that feels like.
Yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the Jerome...
Long went missing from the Tech Center this morning along with a very dangerous...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
It's a hundred degrees...
Yeah, they call me Dar-...
I assume you want that to go.
Assumptions are always...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
Like I say, Doc Long's...
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
Your fellow hero, untouched...
No.

I would've in another life.

...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
...somehow. 
There's something else too.
INT. U.S. RESEARCH LABORATORY/CORRIDOR - NIGHT.
And where are you going?
Hey, doc.  Might wanna...

...forcing him to strike.  And only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
Some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
Everything will die, Mason.
 The only one who understands what this me-...
Tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
Yeah, yeah...
...Mason?
...-lem?
So you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
I didn't sell the boy any...


...tunnel now!
If that's what it says.
A ruler?
My usual fee, plus a bonus if I come up with any results.
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
No. She's probably scared to death.
Wouldn't it be useful to talk to her?
Yeah. Do you remember the last time you talked to Mulwray?
Where is she?
That's where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. You'd lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. He made this city.
No, Mr. Gittes. That's what I am doing with the Valley. The bond issue passes Tuesday. There'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I'm doing it.
Either that or she'll be in jail.
Just bring your checkbook.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
Forget it. I only mention it to illustrate a point...
Call me Jake. Careful driving home, Curly.
No thanks.
Curly, where's your car?
Off the alley.
I'll throw that in too.
Sue the shit out of 'em.
Yeah, they are.
No. It was an accident.
I don't.
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Just to be on the safe side, we had Loach here give you a ring.
C'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? Mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! Now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
Too late for what?
Oh, Christ. Escobar, you don't know what's going on. Let her go. I'll explain it later.
Gittes, stay outta this.
Jake, you're very disturbed. You're crazy. That's her father.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Mr. Gittes.
Iced tea.
Mrs. Mulwray?
Nothing personal, Mrs. Mulwray, I just --
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
You mean you don't know where you were?
You sure shout that?
Get in the car.
When was the last time?
What about it?
You saw my fa... father? When?
This morning.
It's possible.
You mean she just found out?
Yes.
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
Katherine?... Katherine who?
Back to Mexico.
Oh yeah? You pick up the watch?
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
Oh no.
You'll find one of those people.
Okay.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Neither do I, actually. But you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
Mr. Gittes! That's an outrageous accusation.  I don't know what you're talking about.
I said, the northwest valley.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
City of La Habra Heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
Yeah, I'll do that.
He's not in, Mr.?
He did or he didn't?
Yes.
Mr. Mulwray felt the public should own the display. The water. If you'll just read the display.
Along with Mr. Mulwray.
Yes. Yes, they were partners.
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!!  Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Too bad!
That's right, Modern Times.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
You shouldn't tell me that now. After all these years!  I put all your things in here. Go in, go in...
What the fuck you talking about? You getting into the act too, Toto? Titanus has trouble giving me even one copy and I have to say thanks! If I ask for two, the least they'll do is cut off my head and play ball with it!
OK...
Where is he?
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
You don't really think so?
I do.  I do.  I mean, since you're running for Governor - and you want to be elected -  I think it's wonderful you're going to be elected.  Only -  -  Can I say something?
Susie?  I called her myself the day after he died.  I thought maybe somebody ought to...  She couldn't even come to the 'phone.
Maybe that was something he lost. Mr. Kane was a man that lost - almost everything he had -  You ought to talk to Bradford Leland. He could tell you a lot.  I wish I could tell you where Leland is, but I don't know myself.  He may be out of town somewhere - he may be dead.
Nothing particular the matter with him, they tell me.  Just - 
Who said anything about brooms?
Certainly not.
Kane?  Charlie?  Where is he?
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough.  The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
It's not our function to report the gossip of housewives.  If we were interested in that kind of thing, Mr. Kane, we could fill the paper twice over daily -
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
That's Leland, isn't it?
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
I always like to see the funny side of things.  No sense crying when you don't have to.  And you're so funny.  Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
That's a ripe old age -  What do you do?
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
I mean in New York.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think -  - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business.  You've got no right -
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan.  Right now -
I'm not sorry.
No, you're not.
Susan, don't go!  Susan, please!
I must refuse to allow you to continue in this vein, Mr. Kane.
Can you prove it isn't?
Do you know what that is?
It's a good idea for a newspaper.  Four hundred sixy thousand.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad.  We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social!  The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes -  I tell you, Brad, I envy you.  By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
I mean I've got a job for you.
What?
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
The personal note is all there is to it.  It's all there ever is to it.  It's all there every is to anything!  Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people.  They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
Yes.  Now, will you let me go to Chicago?
That's what you think, is it, Jim?
Rawlston is my boss.
I don't know.  He was disappointed in the world.  So he built one of his own -  An absolute monarchy -  It was something bigger than an opera house anyway -  Nurse!  Say, I'll tell you one thing you can do for me, young fellow.
On your way out, stop at a cigar store, will you, and send me up a couple of cigars?
We will assume full management of the Colorado Lode - of which you, Mrs. Kane, are the sole owner.
Right here, Mrs. Kane.
This is Mr. Thatcher, Charles.
We're leaving tonight.  As soon as they're through photographing the stuff -
I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
I know.  If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond.  That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him.  He knows where the bodies are buried.
I'm not from a newspaper exactly, I -
Am I sure?
Sure. Go ahead.
You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work.
Yeah, but not in here.
Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around?
Why aren't there any lights?
You're kidding.
And I'm caught in the middle-torn between my loyalty for the boss, and my desire to piss with the light on.
Just now.
Very dramatic, I thought.
Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even.
No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.
Tell me I don't have something to do with it.
Look how full of yourself you are.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years.
But can we date?
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
He went to rent a movie, but he hasn't gotten back yet. Ah, screw it; I'll just lock the store up and leave him a note.
Well, me I guess.  So, I shall take my leave of you, but I will return in a little while, at which time-yes-I would love to go for dinner and a movie with you.
Like what?
How 'bout covering point!? You suck!
So?
What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one.
Bunch of savages in this town.
Don't screw with it. It makes us look suspicious.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
That's cheating?
I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.
Allan Harris.
In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.
You think things would be any different now?
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.
Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.
I guess.
Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married.
Not a fucking word! Slippery shit!
FUCK!
You know what pisses me off the most?
See? There you go again.
At least let me maintain some semblance of managerial control here.
She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died mid-backstroke.
True, but do you know how many people are going to be there? All of our old classmates, to say the least.
I'm not missing what's probably going to be the social event of the season.
But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?
Twenty-two; same as us.
How'd he die?
You know.
Listen to you.
So the casket fell over! Big deal!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Just... go! Go open the video store.
You work in a video store!
If you must.
I'm happy.
I'm not.
Could be.
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Why do I have this life?
All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.
My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.
Why do I say that?  Randal... forget it.
Fuck you. Fuck you, pal. Listen to you trying to pass the buck again. I'm the source of all your misery. Who closed the store to play hockey? Who closed the store to attend a wake? Who tried to win back an ex- girlfriend without even discussing how he felt with his present one? You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  "I'm not even supposed to be here today."  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?
You need a ride?
I'll call you. Let you know.
Thirty-fire.
Caitlin used to talk about him all the time.
THE GLADES MOTEL?
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
They are not.
How much can you bench?
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
No, she's getting married.
Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk.
I'm not dealing.
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
Actually, that's his night job.
Yeah, but...
Yeah, okay. Go ahead.
I hate this fucking place.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
What were you doing up so late?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
"Be there?"
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
Oh, you think so?
Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
All right. Name it.
Where?
Sylvan can be talked into anything.
Please calm down.
Yeah, I went down on a few guys...
...And one of those guys was you! The last one, I might add, which-if you're too stupid to comprehend- means that I've been faithful to you since we met! All the other guys I went with before I met you, so, if you want to have a complex about it, go ahead!  But don't look at me like I'm the town whore, because you were plenty busy yourself, before you met me!
Thank you for the lasagne.
I don't want to go back with her...
I think it's coming now...
Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
He's your cousin?
English.  Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy.
That's tight. Solid.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
No, I wasn't.
I only pointed out that you weren't paying any attention to what I was saying.
Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning.
I have first dibs.
I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape.
Twenty bucks.
I just talked to her on Monday. We still hang out on weekends.
Where's the radio?
So, what do you see?
This is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, Travers.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Hey, anything for a friend. How's the knee?
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
There wasn't time for anything else.
Six...
Patience my love, patience.
You can stop right there.
Oh, please.
A lot of things fell apart up there.
Did I miss something?
Resuscitation?
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
And I can't leave.
I haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
I only came back for you.
How'd you get up here?
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
What about you?
Gabe?  Wait 'til I get over there.  Tie the rope so I can come across.
What the hell's going on?
No, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. Nobody's worth that much on the open market.  Except you, the loyal one.  Didn't I tell you to warm the place up?
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
Half a day.
You're looking at him.
Where's the rest of the team?
These are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
What did you do that for?
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
Great, sir. Great.
Won't you join me, sir?
Help you.
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a mile down the road. I suggest you use that.
How do you do, sir?
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might have some for me who'se sweated over you. He slaps Alex on the knee.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was playing Beethoven.
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much down in spirits.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Surprise?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
You wanna be sick?
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff it. Minister rises.
Alexander de Large, sir.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Yes, sir, Church of England, sir.
Blue eyes?
Lice?
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Vitamins will it be then?
You mean like going to the pictures?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Yes?
Isn't the plumage beautiful?
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Amen. They cross themselves.
Have you been receiving medical treatment for any serious illness?
Sir.
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?
Big, big money.
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
Sure.  I'm starting an 800 hotline.  Caught part of your phone call.  And even if I hadn't, there's the dark pinstripe, Armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like Bottega...
Most of the time.
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
He's...what?  Say again?  We're in cell hell...
Dmitri hired him!  He's already killed all your witnesses, now he's coming after you!  He was stalking you when I dropped you off.  I don't know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
No, no, <u>wait</u>...
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
This vehicle's not safe to drive. We're gonna have to impound it.  Get you towed.  Step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I'm sorry, sir, you'll have to find another cab.
I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
Neither do I.  But my children, they're still young.  Do you know who they like even more than jolly old Saint Nicholas?  His helper, Black Peter. An old Russian fairy tale tells of how Santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  That was Black Peter's job.  He was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  And if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  That was a warning.  If they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. And they would never be seen again.
Twenty five?
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
Can you fax me his picture?  His license or something?  What do you mean you don't have that there?  Anybody else in the cab?
Oh, right.  The guy flipped out or something?  Killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
Elvis?
Jesus.  Two in one night?
Tell my son.  You have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
I brought you flowers.
Who the hell is this?
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
Where you been the last two hours? Your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you didn't show up.
An apology.
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
Bullshit.  You probably know the light schedules, too.  Listen, I'm in town tonight on a closing.  Five stops, one night.  I gotta catch a six a.m. flight.  I got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  Why don't you hang with me?
Yeah, yeah.  Shit, man.  Guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
Two...
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps.
I think so.
South Central.
I told you we had other stops to make tonight.
Yes.
How?
Then don't let me get cornered, Max. You don't have the trunk space.
So what?
No you don't.
Yeah.
Yes, Max?
God, are you always this prosaic?  You don't learn jazz, it's not something you're <u>taught.</u> It's like breathing, like life.  Like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
I killed him.  When I was 15.  He was my first.  Nah, wishful thinking.  Liver cancer.
Why?
I don't get it.
No client has ever seen my face, and I intend to keep it that way.  Besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, I don't wanna be there for it.
Max.  You threw my briefcase in the river.  You've got balls bigger than Toledo.
You get benefits?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
Who's Heller?
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
But you know what?  Nothing matters, anyway.  We are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  Right? Yeah.  That's one thing I've got to thank you for, bro.  And I never saw it that way...
Let her go.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
All I know is, they said to send you and the body to the basement.
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Mississippi?
Not for years.
I think you're different.
No.
Was waiting till I knew you better.  Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
I've been reading up on it.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Never, but I've been practicing.
How is it possible?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
Okay, I will.
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  But first things first.
Because he believed me.
I'm sorry.
You saw me standing alone ...
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
I don't know...
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
It was.  It was.
A dog.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
I don't believe you.
You do recognize it then?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
I don't know if you're the best lawyer I've got or a high school sophomore.
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
What?
-- It's extremely unlikely that they had any idea what they were looking at.
And only two probabilities:  One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
No doubt.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
You can't just pull the plug, David.
Meaning...
You must have checked the signal for polarization modulation already...
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Are you threatening me?
No primer.
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Thank you, Doctor.  Now --
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
Childhood is over, Ellie.  It's time to grow up.
I didn't realize I was out.
And in return?
What are you talking about?  It's over.
-- of Hadden Industries.
Perhaps.  But on the off-chance that it is a 'doomsday device' of some kind, I plan to be very far away from your lovely Texas when it is activated.
Peter Valerian.
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
The V.L.A.?
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
Like it or not.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction?  What day is this?
'My father's house has many mansions.'
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Did you love him?
Yes.  Very much.
In other words.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I don't follow.
I don't know.  But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
Maybe that's okay.
I'm sorry.
What is it?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
How would you propose we handle it, Doctor?
What is it?
But I made this arrangement --
I got two years.
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
I... I... I...
Git to work!
Yes sir, Boss Paul!
I guess you could say I wasn't thinkin', Captain.
Well, you got yourself some time now. Two years. Hell, that ain't much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. We got one who's got all of it. We got all kinds and you gonna fit in real good. Course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. You'll learn the rules. It's all up to you. I can be a good guy or I can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it's up to you.
Hey, Tattoo!
Borrowin'.
Tramp! Beautiful!
Look, she's got paint on her toenails! Oh Lord, whatever I done, don't strike me blind for 'nother couple minutes. Oh you Lucille!
Pair'a nines.
He's eatin' steak and corn with butter and green beans and...
What for?
A cold drink? Okay?
They ain't never seen a bull gang before.
We got it locked in the sock.
Yeah, I know. But what we gotta do first is stretch that l'il ol' belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
You just said he could eat anything.
You ever see mah boy throw up? Shut your mouth and put up your money!
Call.
Kick a buck.
This is a big day for the guards. They get to remind us who's boss.
How about you tryin' to make me?
Well!  Aren't we the daring one? What's morbid and ghastly enough in the news to make Doctor Helen set foot outside her door?  The antenna is gone off her car again.  I had no music, all the way to the market.  Let me find a garage for it?
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
I'm okay.  I really kind of enjoyed it.
He told me he had done two others just like it.
When was that?
You get me out first.
You were going to make a delivery to Peter Kurten for Daryll Lee Cullum.  I want Kurten's phone number.
You already made the delivery?
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
I don't know.  I'd like to know where he is.
Damn!  I gave that to Conrad, too! That guy!  I told Conrad deliver to Kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
It's Daryll Lee Cullum, isn't it?
You know I can't do that.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
Do anything you want to me.  I give myself to you.  Only put the knife down.  Isn't this what you always wanted?  I know it's what we all want, to love and to loved.  I could love you.  You could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
Will you go.  Andy, make them go.
I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo.  He used their own stockings to strangle them.  Tied in a bow-knot.
Look at the bottom of the screen. You see the icon with the arrow pointing left?  Click on that... twice.
They weren't going to show it to me?!  The arrogance!  It's my <u>life</u>!
A man?  I thought he was a boy.  This last Christmas was the happiest Christmas I had in the last ten years... you know why?  It was the first Christmas in six years I was not in love.  Son of a bitch <u>married men</u>!  Who cares about marriage, the bed just gets crowded and noisy?!
Daryll Lee Cullum?  I don't think so.  If he's escaped we'd have the National Guard, cops'd be crawling through sewers.  You'd have a guard on your front door.
You called us, Doctor, if you don't want to look at them here, how about downtown.  I'll drive you down...
In the sixties.  He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
Well.  Another time, then.  I'll be all right.  He's not going to attack me; what I' m rally afraid of is all in my own head, Ruben.
They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me... I liked it.
He's just mad he let me keep the espresso machine.  We heard from Doctor Hudson?
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Yeah, everything's different.
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
It's against your rules that I try to help a witness who's scared shitless?  Who's...
Helen... excuse me, we...
Talk to Nikko...!
Right.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
What the hell you need her for?
Give him <u>that</u>pompous son of a bitch.
You got a suspect...
You messed with the evidence.
Don't give me six years!  You never divorced Patty, did you?  So what'd you expect from M.J.?
Did you come?
We were interrupted. I had to go back to the set...
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
My last lesson's next week.  James... my car...
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
And you had sex with all of these men in cars? Only in cars?
Hard to say.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
I did this already.
Well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
You always throw the best dinner parties, Letty.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Ecru.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Mom, please.
Mom, I was there, and I just, I was so... They didn't have the olives, and I, I got so upset. I don't know how it happened.
Ruth's already taken him home.
Tomorrow?
As soon as Dr. Emlee says.
Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.
It's got a green dot on its back. I can't go to sleep with it watching me.
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
Very romantic setting.
So are you engaged, or what?
What's my rap?
My Grandma Rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. Other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  But even though they end up crooked, they're still trees, just like the straight ones.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Not a one.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
It's sex time.
Promise?
It wasn't exactly a lie.
We both talked to her, Michael. And your dad.
I didn't talk to her about medications, Michael. Don't be silly.
I love you too, Letty.     I love you, too.
I will. And you make sure you take care of yourself.
You should go.
I think you're overreacting.
That's a big question.
I hope it wasn't something I did.
Yes, I suppose so.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
Look, Gail, I've been a good teacher.
What does that mean?
Where did they go?
I'm your worst fuckin' nightmare. Now, if you don't want me to keep on hurting you, it's important that I believe you and right now I don't. So tell me, where did they go?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
No.
A million! I don't have that kind of money.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
I'm not here to negotiate.
Your own brother? You couldn't send someone else to do it?
But you were there?
Yes.
Not such a good friend.   May I reach in my pocket?
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
You have something for me?
I'm not any closer than you are.
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
I thought they came with batteries.
What is that a threat? Are you fuckin' threatening me, Marcel?
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
I think he'd cut his dick off if Bastaldi told him to.
Can I trust you, Sami?
Does it really matter what I say?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I've got a way with people.
Why haven't you turned us in?
Yeah. All set. Tomorrow morning. Ten o'clock. Room 211. Barclay Hotel on River Street. Oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I'm going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
I'll tell you when it's time.
There's just one more thing I need you to do.
Hard to say.
Well, I must say you're handling it very well.
The Holiday Hotel.
There must be half a million dollars here though.
Hey, I was told to come here by Marcel. You guys don't want me, I'll be more than happy to leave.
Okay.    I will have a beer.
I've never driven a Cadillac before.
Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.
What are we going to do, take a taxi?
Okay.   You can be Elvis.
Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
Give it to me, Sami.
Yeah.   It's mine.
Although a cartoon I feel he shares a universal theme: We are all searching for love. No?
I know where she went.
Glenmorangie is very good.
Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
No.
I'm sorry things went so wrong today.
I thought I'd listen to some of the tapes. See what's so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
I don't want anything. I just wanted to say... that I may have... overreacted a little the other day.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
Why were you spying on the Yus?
What's it to you?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
It's the Giang Hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. Exciting, isn't it?
So what if I don't?
He is my defeated foe!
Do you know her?
Beautiful but dangerous.  Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  It's 400 years old.
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
By the way, I'm a real Manchurian.
Give it back.
Fine.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
But it's not your sword anymore. You gave it to Sir Te.
She's out there, but I doubt she'll show herself.  We'll keep our eyes open.  Sooner or later, she'll come for the girl.
To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
I don't know...
Yes, though I doubt he's involved in this.
The best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
You know, you sure got a hard-on for a guy that's guilty of zip on paper.  Top Dollar runs Showtime; what's the matter, don't you like adult entertainment?
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
You buying?
No onions?
They make you fart.
You must listen carefully:  the Fire Department will be here soon. There is an injured man in the alley who needs assistance.  As Shelly Webster once needed your assistance, and as you are shortly going to need my assistance.
Fucking A, my friend.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
I should be trying to stop you.
Right.  You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward?
No.  I have one more thing to do.
Well, how's your friend?
Oh.
Right.
You don't even remember...
I ain't got no fuckin' ring.
I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ?
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Does it hurt?
Your pain ends now.
Shut up.
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Very well, it's your ass.
Anybody violates my turf -- our turf -- I'll rip out there heart and show it to 'em.
Nice speech.  What's it supposed to mean?
You heard me.
I have his journal.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Romantic? He rapes her.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
It's my house.
I said I was sorry.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
That's none of your business.
That's also none of your business.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Reading.
Somerset Maugham.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Okay.
Oh please.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Because I'm in love with you.
I think that's for the best.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
Hi.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
That's great.
What are you scared of?
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
Cool.
You think he'll like it?
He'll love it.
Want a blow job?
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
Honey, is something wrong?
Get out of here.
And you think she bought it?
Ronald?
What do you mean?
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Care to make a wager on that?
Shhh.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
Any day now.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Mock, mock, mock.
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
I have a flair for drama.
Come again?
Get out!
I know. She's so young and he's so -
It's the least I can do.
Excuse me.
You must be Sebastian. I've heard such nice things about you.
Annette! Annette!
I understand. Good night.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Don't worry about it.
Kathryn. Did you hit her?
We don't even like them,  I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it.  It was his first wife's favorite picture.  She was an artist.
It's one of the clearest memories I have. Twelfth night...burning pine... and mummers' plays.
Did you ever make a wish?
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
I got my wish anyway.
It's early yet.
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
I live right here.
Where did you mail them?
It was on account of the birthday party.
Why didn't you run after them?
And who did the voice belong to?
Daddy, it's true.
But...
No.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
I shall want you for always.
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Oh yes they do.  Look.  One is like a tall princess.
My dolls. We can pretend.
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
I shall wear it in my hair!
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
That means I can go alone?
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
But she's such a nice lady.
It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
Probably hit by a car. Hard to see things in the twilight.
But it was alive  it was fast and strong!
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
Who is she?
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
Now, I don't know Amy --
Wait a minute. Listen.
Indeed I did. Up and down the garden she went, laughing and singing to herself.
Amy has too many fancies -- too few friends. It worries me. It doesn't seem normal.
No.
I mean where on your body?
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
It's okay if you are, we just want to know. I don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
I never thought of it like that. I never know what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?
And he was ripped limb from limb?
You don't think so? You either did or your didn't.
Did you get smashed or what? You have to eat if you're drinking. And not just those little salads.
I couldn't stop eating steak. I felt out of control -- like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I couldn't get enough. And then Gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
My vision got worse again.
What the hell is the tampon test?
There is a man's arm in my bed.
I put it down the garbage disposal.
First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
Ignore it.
Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I'm not sure -- I don't get how it works.
We don't know you're a werewolf. It might never happen again. You have to get on with your life.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
No. I can't take that chance. I'd rather kill myself.
Sure. See ya.
Yes I do have to pee!
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
This really isn't a good time.
Yeah?
Script coverage?
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
I just don't know if I should be dating anyone right now.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
I knew you wouldn't believe me! Just go away. Go very far away!
Oh, I see... interesting theory.
Let's explore this. What makes you feel you're a werewolf?
No, take it.
Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to do with me?
Don't be stupid George. Obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. She might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
You're some catch Lloyd.
She's not a suspect. What is her motive? There's nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
This one walk you home too?
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
And fifth, you're dating her.
Which brings up an interesting point. I wasn't following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened to be there...
And that was 28 days ago today.
Just visiting my patient.
Germs, sir.  These places are full of them.
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Well be more careful, please.
Don't know that either.
What?  Who has?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Yes.
You think I haven't been trying!  It's like there was never anything there.  Just water.
Well...
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
Don't ask stupid questions.  Look at it.
I'm...  being...  punished.
Right.
No more than the usual.
Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
Oh... Okay.
Great.
Share...
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.'  So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
Just don't call him, Alan!
Yes.
I was a senator, you know.
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady...  She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr.  I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
Clean.
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
And look at this.  Russell came around on the trade bill.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
Don't do this.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
They could put you in jail.
I'm not sure.
Well -- take care.
I see what you mean.
I don't think so.
At a press conference.
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
Well...
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
I don't understand.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Home.
It's just so strange...
I guess.
Yes.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
... Me, too.
All set.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
To look...look for a place...a place to live in...an empty place...a... new...place...
Let's just....wait a minute. Get a better look.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
Listen, Missy. I am the only due process that has ta be served aroun' tyere and one of the people doin' the servin' from now on is gonna be you. Now you been prancin' aroun' the Cave like yer ass was glass fer long enough! All that's
Gasparilla?
That sounds like a curse to me.
Datura! Miguel knew it! Datura, he was shouting! Datura Metel!
We got a boat.
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
I got some fuel comin' out and, I hope, some automatic rifles.
We know what's down there. We did the loading' and unloadin' when the stuff came ashore in the early days. A direct hit oughta do more than a few weeks worth o' damage.
Come on!
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
Oh, I have no doubt.
That bastard. I didn't think he'd make his move so fast.
I want you to leave. Then maybe...
I am not...a guerilla fighter, Toby. I'm not a pioneer. I'm not...I'm not strong that way. I need...
I said, I'll take care of them. Just leave them there. Go help with the rest of the gear.
To fucking Mutt.
Knox?
Knox Overstreet.
Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
It will?  How do you figure?
No, I've been calm all my life!  If I don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
How about a trig study group?  Right after dinner.
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
But I thought-
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
Good.  We're very excited about him.  He was a Rhodes Scholar, you know.
I'm in.
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
But, Chris...
Huh?
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
You can't be in here.
Just like that?!  You just knew?
It's just for a little while. You promised.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
A madman.  Perhaps he was.  What kind of madman?  Don't think!  Answer.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
His hands reach out and choke me All the time he mumbles slowly.  Truth... Truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
Don't stop!
Okay.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
She won't even see me, Pitts.
She's practically engaged to Chet Danburry.  Mr. Mondo Jocko himself.
Nothing.  No mention of it.
Then you can help him.
Good luck.
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Did you really think I wouldn't find out?!  "My niece is in a play with your son," Mrs. Marks says.  "You must be mistaken," I say.  "My son isn't in a play."  You made a liar out of me, Neil! Now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
Oh, so you're that Anderson.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
I know that.  What's it got to do with you?
Hell no, but that's not the point.  The point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, I know what I want, and for the first time I'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! Carpe diem, goddamn it!
Won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
Oh. 
Yes, and acting!  It's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. Most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! If I could get the parts, I could live dozens of lives.
Do you have to quit the play?
He's the owner...
I don't know what these things are ...all I know is...
You know what they say...the classics are eternal.
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Take note Mr. Mason...this is why you hire a professional...No whining. No excuses.
I don't mind him...but I do think it's time for him to get back down below with the rest of the playgroup.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
How soon can we get up and running?
We can't...we got one engine dead, and the other limping badly.
You're going to have to get a new one.
I'm not a thief.
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Seen a lot of islands?
Self sufficient...
Yeah you did...
You know what kind of force it took to rip open the bow of this ship? A million little things like this...
Soon as I get over the heart attack...
Forget them...
Seafood salad.  You ever operate a jet ski?
Line it up now, nice and easy...
Joey...
Nothing.
I'm looking...
I know...
You want 'em?
Get the boots.
I know, but...
Vince thinks... you know...
I'm tellin' you she does it, Vince! With twenty guys you know!
Worse since she talked to who?
I'm glad. Seriously... I'm very glad.
You talk to him?
Yeah.
Everybody love Linda.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
How you like to have nice fuck with Linda? You like that? Special, crazy fuck just like with Linda?
Get anything?
Vince!!!
Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
Nick, she won't say why.
Linda, what's the matter?
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Would you?
I don't know! I don't know either!
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Naw, it's... This guy wants his money.
Oh, it's great. Fine.
I don't know.
Playing.
Playing?
Who the hell knows!
This is horrible!
Sure. Sure, Sal. We're going home.
Huh?
So do I.
What do you think about?
I mean forget Sal... Sal can't take it, Nick.
More bullets in the gun?
But, Nick... Hey, I mean, where would a guy like Merle get money like this?
Naw.  Uh-huh.
No!
In the timeless words of Squire Albert...
The fuck you didn't!... Gimme that!
Down.
Jesus.  Sweet Jesus.  We've got trouble.
What did you say?
Avon Lady!
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
We seem to've come across a 211, sir.
I got it.  I got it.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Give me a break, Sanchez.  It's like riding a bike.
Whoa.  Don't touch that.  <u>Pursuit</u> <u>Mode</u>.  Auto pilot.  Computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  Installed Fall 2006.  Underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
Good night, Wade.
We get to peek into Doucet's brain.
Yes, sir.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
Hospital food.
You never want to find out.
He lied to me again.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
What Grange?
-- in gold.
Doesn't satisfy, eh? Well -- that's too bad....
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
That's right, Mr. Stone -- there is --  -- just one little formality. I'd like your signature here -- see. And when it's done -- it's done for seven years.  It's our usual form. Of course -- we may be able to take up the question of a renewal in due time.
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
Yes, indeed. But not now. Not for seven years. Oh, I almost forgot -- what is the date?
I have still a year -- a year to make up for everything.
Ten throws it is.
Seems like it's my fault, Mr. Webster.
They'd have a good neighbor, Jabez -- and that's worth much more than anything else -- much, much more!
Then I'll just christen the jug, with your permission, Stone. Somehow or other, waiting's wonderfully shorter with a jug.
Breakfast ... Ah! ... Come along friends, Ma Stone's a cook this side of heaven.
Camomile tea!
Selectman? Selectman of the village? Me?
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
I will, Mary -- always thought a man could be stronger alone -- seems I've been wrong about that.
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Looks right elegant, Mary.
Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
Mary! Come back ...
Not on the Sabbath you won't, Jabez!
I dunno.
Oh, go along with you! As if it mattered to a grandma! But p'raps you got an even chance.
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
The law is the law. Good-bye, Mary.
Belle, give the Sheriff a cup of rum.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
I'll do my best, Mary.
It even kicked back -- once at you, didn't it?
There, Mr. Webster.  All open and above-board and in due and legal form.
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
Very well. -- You shall have your trial, Mr. Webster. The case is hardly one for an ordinary jury --
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
What are you going to do?
Ellis, what have you told them?
And if he alters it...?						*
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
I don't want neutral...I want dead --
Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy?
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
You want to know my idea of a marriage? It's a partnership where people help each other over the rough spots -- console each other when there's a down...and when there's an up, well, hell, a little Goddamn applause or an attaboy wouldn't be too bad.  I needed that, John.  I deserved that.
Holly Gennero?
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
Thanks...partner.
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I hope so.  But that's up to the guy upstairs.  Upstairs...  ...Hans, you bastard...what were you doing?
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
How do you know?
Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know --
Whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, Gene?
Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
What about the kids?
They're not after you, they're after me.
Yeah.  A lot of guns.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Well.... huh ...
That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
You're really crazy.
What?
Well... they told me that I was an accomplice...
Are they on the phone still?
Yeah... yeah!
Who's this?
... But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay?
I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
I frisk you?
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position?
Oh, no ... Women is all we got.
Nothin' doin'.  I give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
Yeah ...
Okay ...
He's totally unstable.  He'll make a mistake.
Okay, don't worry about it.  Stick it in the bag...
Sal, get 'em in the vault.
Mulvaney...
Ah, I know!  You're being very cooperative.  I got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
The TV ... they want to talk to you ...
I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule.  Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication?
Sure - we like you.
Why not?
What about Howard?
Did you always call him Junior.
You stopped?  Why?
Your body is the temple of the Lord.
Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go?
How'd that happen?
I want him to think that.
But do you mean it?
Does that still go?
They keep sayin' two homosexuals. I'm not a homosexual.  I want you to stop them saying that.
The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad.
I forgot she's in here.
Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on...
... Just give me time to think...
Yeah - it looks real official.
Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
What's wrong with that?  The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him.  Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Mom.  Mom.  There are some things a mother shouldn't say in front of her son.
What'll you do?  Come out.
What the hell for?  Twenty-five years in the pen?
Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card.
Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison?
<i>Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil.</i>  <i>There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.</i>
<i>That's the crew. They follow us.</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>I forgot.</i>
Yes.
<i>The system hasn't been updated.</i>
What?
<i>The money exchange will take place at Top of the World at the Stratosphere. Get there at exactly midnight.</i>
Yes.
No. Please enlighten me.
Chi-Chi!  CHI-CHI!
Be kind to your sitter.
<i>Whatever.</i> He's a criminal. And this Ed Martin character is a complete loser.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.
Hello?
He said... take his right arm.
Exactly. Why don't you leave the guns behind this time? Go in with only batons, brass knuckles, and numb-chucks.
<i>House is a wreck/ Gotta collect my check/ Gotta perfume my neck/ But keep yo hands off the weave cuz this black bitch don't suck the dick.</i>
Check this out.  Y'know Sal's.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
And?
Yeah, I asked him.  I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's.  He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
You come in here at least three times a day.  You a retard?  A buck fifty.
What da fuck!  Are you deaf?
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
Don't worry about it.  But when it happens and I'm in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don't ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
Is it a good morning?
C'mere, Doctor.
I'm going with you.
See ya around.
Innocent!
I might be, but you're not welcome here.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now.  Where's the stuff?
Twenty "C" Duracells.
D!  D!  D!  You dumb motherfucker. Learn how to speak English first.  D.
Don't worry about it.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
Where we goin'?
I wants my money.  I wants to get paid.
Don't even ask about your money. Your money wouldn't even pay for that window you smashed.
We all know you're gonna get over with the insurance money anyway! Ya know da deal.
My salary.  Two-fifty.
Hot.  Hot.
Come in then.
How else was I going to get you here?  I haven't seen you in a week.
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
Trust me.
It's 'pose to be cold.
Meda.  Meda.
Be a man.
You're to the curb.  You better step off.  Get a life.
Magic Johnson.
It's e-vit-able.
Y'know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." Kick his ass.
I was going to buy a slice.
I love you.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
You listening to me?
And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
Mookie, you're fucking up.
Since when do you know what's best for us?
Too many pizzerias already there.
So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so what if we're a minority.  I've never had no trouble with dese people, don't want none either, so don't start none.  This is America.  Sal's Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all?  Well, you don't.  I'm your father, you better remember that.
'Bout time, Pop.
Depends how you define 'new'...
Yeah. How'd you know?
Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine.  I'm Jessica Matthews.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
Come over around seven.
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
Just down the hall.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
What?
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
I know I am, Mom.
Oh Lloyd, you gotta taste my Mom's pie!
That's stupid! I happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Home school? What's that?
Is that what I think it is?
Cool.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
Me too!
Yeah, it's nice. And your friend TURK is totally great.
Wow.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
Sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in Special Needs.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
I can't help my heart. And when I'm your dad, you'll have to do as I say.
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Hey, teach, how'd you get so smart?
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
They can't be real.
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
HARRY! Here he comes.
You and me? Dream on, desperado.
Well, I could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
Alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
Just wanted to see how your doing.
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
The answer is George Jefferson.
Nothing. Why, whaddya hear?
Who?
Am not.
No. Look.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
But I ate your Mom's pie.
I... found that rock.
Right. She's so proud of her boyfriend.
That's it. Build him a float for the Thanksgiving Day parade!
LLOYD, what I'm saying is we may already have what we want.
What?
Try one in a million!
Well, what should we do?
That's gross.
I'm not interested. Not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
Poor question. Too wordy. A good question gets right to the point. Example, where's my chest?
That's not your tape.
Oh no, I know that class isn't for me. But I'm happy for you guys.
This school's never had one before. I'd like to talk to you and all your special friends.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Fine. Give me the doll hairs.
I liked it a lot.
Will that be on the midterm?
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Uh, no and I don't appreciate...turn down here!
Good. Good. Good. Well, that's good.
And, take some more pictures.
It's a surprise.
She's been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
Why don't you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. I have to pay somebody a little visit.
Love it!
I shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
Yes?
Yes?... How was your journey?
Many machines on Ix... new machines.
Sire!
Not in the mood?! Mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real.
My Lord?
Then I will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.
As the legend says.
Someone started another thumper....  We're not alone.
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
Could I be known as Paul Muad'dib?
The most lethal poison in the Universe.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach.
SILENCE!
We have our new army.  Dr. Yueh, put the weirding module on him.
Huh?
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
No more.  I haven't worked in four years.  This town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I'm just an ex-bogeyman.  Make a right.
The <u>women</u>?
You must be double-jointed, and you must be Hungarian.  Vampira, look at me!  Stare into my eyes.
I am always on time.
Uh, Eddie, do you have my money?
Of course!
They do?  Shoot.  There <u>must</u> be a way to get around that...
Ah!  This is very exciting.
So how'd we do?
Nonsense!  You look great --  Look, uh, why don't you lie down and take a little nap?  We'll film around you for a while.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Don't worry.  Everything's gonna be all right.
No, you look good.  And the tests came back fine.  C'mon...
Perfect.
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
I just wish you coulda seen the movie.
I don't know.  Where?
Ssh!  He's so big!  He's a <u>monster</u>! Can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
Rolling.
Sound!
H-how'd you know?!
My pleasure.  I'm always happy to assist in a little larceny.
Well... there's a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. Apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
Ed, it was only one review.
Ed, you're still young.  This is the part of your life when you're <u>supposed</u> to be struggling.
It takes me comfortable.
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material.  Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Wood Productions.  The mark of quality.
I understand you just moved here?
That's all??  That seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
Yeah.  Exactly!
Really?!  Well good for you.
Ah!  Atomic Age stuff, huh?  I like it.  I'll tell you what, Mr. Ward.  Why don't you leave those film cans, and my associates and I will take a look at your little opus.  Maybe we can do business together.
Hruphh...?
Um, I understand that this science friction is popular -- but don't the big hits always have big stars?
I like to think so.
Oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  How 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it's suddenly night???
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Yes, I'm Ed Wood.  I'm here about directing the Christine Jorgensen picture.
You gotta be kiddin' me.
Hello.  You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
I just picked them up on the way over...
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live.  I thought he was much scarier in person.
Bela died.
Dynamite --
Look buddy, I'm a big star.  I've got real offers from real studios.  I don't need to blow some dentist for a part.  So forget it!
I know what <u>that's</u> like.  Anyway, I brought a copy of the script.  You would play the "Ghoul's Wife."
What's uncanny?
Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
Well my cousin Fred met this dame from back East.  She's from "old money," and he thinks she's loaded. And here's the kicker: She's <u>very</u> <u>interested</u> in the picture business!
Yes!
I do.
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
I thought this was a group effort.
I'm directing.
No, I work in pictures.  I'm a director-actor-writer-producer.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
No! Do they show you having sex?
Al!
Our neighbors gave me a ride.
Oh, Al ... This is just...
If Ray would steal this girl from Ed. That would be great.
You know it.
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
We're going to get you a bodyguard, don't worry. Ed, I have some news for you. We're picking up Ed TV for another month!
Leave her be.
You said that.
So do I. So what? I'm doing all right.
Yeah, what - they put some schmuck on TV all day long or something?
Right, right...
Yeah. The camera guy is here.
No. It's a mess.
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
You and Al lived together a few months before you got married -- after Dad left.
Oh my God!!
Chicken pox? I was six. He didn't leave 'til I was twelve.
St. Joseph's.
One thing led to another. He was my husband once.
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Welcome to work, Ed.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
So? What do they think -- we're not kids --
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Somewhere.
Ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that I don't get if I qu -- it's too complicated. I -- Besides...
It's what I do. I yell "Geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
I was... having dinner with Shari and her parents.
What are you drunk?
Show business.
Yeah. I service video equipment.
We're excited.
Oh man! They couldn't pick me! They had to pick you!
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
You watching the ballgame?
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
Cassie...
The whole time? Eighteen years?
I need help. How many times if just one little thing that I needed would've happened, it would've changed everything. If I had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
Thanks... That's ...
Mm.
Ohh... do you own a cat?
Everyone has foibles. Then the whole country sees them on TV and mocks them. Then we have... mocked foibles.
I know.  I know its not by choice.  I just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
Huh.  Okay.  Well, I guess I'd better do my count.
Ethics are...
Oh.  There's one more thing about Tracy I think you should know.
Right
NO, that's fine
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
I'm looking at new cars.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Anywhere you want.  Just so long as we're not gone more than a half-hour.
Why are you doing this?
Doing what?
My house.
You will.
I don't know. Yesterday.  Sunday.
I don't believe you.
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Should we get a what?
We'll let it run awhile
A mistake?  That was no mistake.
Huh?  Oh.  Uh... pears
So?
I don't care.
For what?
Okay, Mr. Popular.  You're on.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Don't you fucking knock?
Merry Christmas yourself, <u>Officer</u>.
You want some advice, Miss Bracken?
Do you enjoy it?
When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way.
How'd you get to know so much about him?
So tell me about it.
He made his play amd he got what he wanted.  They're making him a detective.
Yeah, I hate them.
Him and me both.  <u>Fucking Exley</u>.
Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad.
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Stens?  Was it Stens?
The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
I'm not asking you.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
I was here, hosting a party.  Who was killed and why do you think I can help?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
I don't know.  I swear it!
Anything off.  Anything that didn't make sense.
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
All right, Ed.  Call Sergeant Vincennes.
Did one of the officers work you over a little?
Man, why're you talkin' about Larry?  His business is his business.
Dogs got no reason to live.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
The youngest applicant by eight years.
Dudley, we've been over this.
White's a mindless thug.
Get on it.
You make a mistake?
I want to do it right.
What?
Yeah.  The fact that you guys won't let it get filed away.
Why do men and women usually see each other?
He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
You don't like that you don't know how to play him.  He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do.  That makes him dangerous.
Some reality.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
I work for Patchett.  I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
Right now, before I back down.
Some men get the world.  Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
Yeah, it's subtle.
What's he doing here, Sid?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
I just called it.
Really?  How?
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Brill's dead. He died of small pox when he was two and he was buried in a Kansas field.  My name doesn't matter.
You said he was behind an extortion scheme.
Yes.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
You're crazy.
You drive a black BMW, license plate SRK1339?
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
One-twenty.
Look, my wife is understandably--
I told you no calls.
We're not gonna hurt you.
Same thing?
So what do we do now?
Who?
AmeriTech's data-base.  There's Albert's D.C. office address and his phone's identity code. Now we just reprogram out phone with his ID code and you know what we've got?
C'mon.
My name's Neil. Maybe I can help you.
A receiver tuned permanently to the Senator's phone.
Law enforcement?
Are you sure about this?
Hello. Hello, Maria.
What size?
About what?
What kind of trouble.
Nobody gave you <u>anything</u>?
You should take this seriously.
A guy named Brill. Same guy as always.
Have you been working with Rachel?
Well, you know--
Robert--
Stacy--
Yes.
Good.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
Oh Christ.
I don't believe it is, no.
It's not?
You're right, Mr. DePinto, and maybe I jumped the gun.
It tastes like fish.
Do you like fish?
Never.
It's how he works.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
You're not.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
I went through this with an investigator this morning. If I could--
You're wrong.
Gimme the shoe.
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
Fuck off.
Where's Stacy?
Did you take <u>anything</u>--anything at all--out of those Christmas bags I brought home last week.
I'm not goin' anywhere, Eric. I live here.
Did they take your clothes?
What about jewelry?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
I'm a labor lawyer. There are <u>always</u> mob ties.
Why would the NSA--
So do I!
Jerry?
What does that have to do with you?
What about the tapes?
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Get it.
Destroy his credibility before he goes public. Neutralize him. I don't want anyone listening to a word he has to say. Tell me about Rachel Banks.
Lyle?!
Yes sir.
If they've looked at the video.
He walked right up to me in church. At the holiest time of the wear. He approached me in a sanctified place.  Kill him now.
This guy's carrying the <u>flag</u> for the damn terrorism bill. You think this is the best time to piss him off?
They don't see foreign women in this market.  How much did you pay?
As the wife of one of our party.
He said - be careful.
Her or me?
There's really no need.  This is just a scrapbook.  I should feel obliged.  Thank you.
All true.  Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Dance with me.  I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
It hurts too much.
Do you have your papers, sir?
What?
Am I not talking sense? -  forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers.  I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
I was talking about the girl.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me.  My wife is dying.
I don't know.
A nurse?  Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse?  Great.
Bonjour.
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Rabbit hunting.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
Some gave me a dress.  You know what's great?  What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
I'll have some of your water.  It's hot.
No-one should own music.  The real question is who wrote the song?
Are you planning to be the exception?
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
Me?
You can't kill me.  I died years ago.
Right.
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
K is for Katharine.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
You don't have any money, do you? Just in case there's silk.
Okay.  Get away from here.  Quick.
It's not over everywhere.  I didn't mean literally.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
Does he have to go?
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
I had a hotel room.
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
This is making me incredibly angry.
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  Remind our families we still exist.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
How do you know you're not German if you don't remember anything?
This was your garden?
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
Not interested.
Oh?
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
It is.  Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
In a week.
Something like that.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
It's your mistake.
Okay, 80-20--
Everything.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
It was wrong to deceive you.
I'm sorry.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
FUCKING THING!!!
You can do it.
No, you can't.
This better be worth 1t.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
How does someone get meningitis?
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
Any school you want.
And get someone to help around the house.
Yeah.  I know.
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
I didn't see any medical records in there.
A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line.
It's not about working hard --
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
They skipped that step.
We've got the PG&E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls.  But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG&E fuckers in San Francisco.
Really?  It makes me sick.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
What?  Who?
Erin, you're a big girl.  If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
It's eight million dollars, Erin.  Eight million dollars.
Bullshit.  It was a misunderstanding.  But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
Okay, look.  It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
And, what, I'm not serious?
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing.  Give him another chance.
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Oh, okay.  Here it comes.
The extortion, the threats ...
The firm took in sixty.  That's three percent.  Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
With repeated exposure to toxic levels -- God, anything, really -- respiratory disease, liver failure, heart failure, reproductive failure, chronic headaches, bone or organ deterioration -- plus, of course, any type of cancer.
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
I don't know.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Ten?
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
Better safe than sorry.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
Bull<u>shit</u>, Erin.  Bullshit.
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
That's okay.  I understand.
<u>Excuse me</u>?
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
I know.  But it's good for me.  Now I can help my daughter take care of my grandkids. And it's good for you, too.  Now you have money, you can find a good babysitter, huh? Not the old lady next door.
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
We've discussed this before.
This one I have watched a long time.  All his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  Never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  Adventure, excitement ...  A Jedi craves not these things!
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
You must.  Luke, look at me!
But Han and Leia will surely die.
You're not ready yet.  You still have much to learn.
You won't.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
What happened?
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
How could you know my father? You don't even know who I am.  Can't we get on with this already?
Sergeant, is Commander Skywalker back yet?
But, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
I understand.  A death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... Until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
I shut it off.  What's her royal holiness want?
It can wait.
Yes.
You probably don't.  How could you?  You're so terrified of your own emotions ...
Let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
I take it back.
What is it?
Very funny.  You can let go now .... I'm getting angry.
Yes, you do.
Never heard of that system.
Lando's not a system, he's a man. A gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  The system is called Bespin.  It's a ways from here, but reachable.
Look, sweetheart, I'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. My sentry markers are placed. I'm heading back to the base.
I'll bet.
I'm sorry too.
This ought to be good.
I think not.  But I don't wish my prize to be damaged.  We'll test it first.  Bring in Captain Solo.
Yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  It's connected by a transfer shaft.
We have no use for your kind.
Not yet.  They're working on it now.
We have no choice.  Send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
Sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
Luke, no!  It's a trap.
He'll survive.
To become a Jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
No, no.  Easier, quicker, more seductive.
I've learned so much since then.  And I'll return to finish ... I promise that, master.
Yes, Sir .... we have visuals ... the System is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
He's a gorilla.
I'm a psychiatrist.
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
We'll see.
Where's Plissken?
You're stalling, Eddie.  Talk, you little gringo!
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
Lock fuel rods.
Cuervo's got a place near Venice, where the big birds fly. Nice digs, too. I've been there, y'know.
Cease fire with the bullshit.
Which way?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
Sewers. Come on.
The freeway.
I'm looking for somebody.
Uh-uh. Bluebacks.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
I will not.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
Speak of the devil!...
Because you must! You and only you. Have you forgotten that it was you who freed Excalibur?
In the great book.
Guenevere...
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
And you are the great King? The lords have rebelled. Invaders attack the coasts. Crops don't grow. There is nothing but plague and hunger in the land. Only I am feared. I will be king. You may have lost Excalibur, but I have found my own weapon of power. There.
We fought and won battles, and now one man defeats all my knights? I will go.
--I'm pretty good at stitchery. I've sewn my father's wounds more than once.
No. I meant not to be angry with you, Sir Gahalt. In the idleness that comes with peace gossip has bread its own evil. You merely repeat it. Please, sir, have one of those apples that Lancelot loves, and in that gesture partake of its goodness.
I have kept it.
You, my lord.
--It must wait, child. These good ladies, for whom I intervened once, will honor me with a meal. I am beholden to them now as I was when they begged my protection.
Why?
--I am the fog and mists that rise up from the sea, escaping...
To kill and be king, is that all?
Shall we summon the writer? He's in Paris I believe.
Fuck it.
Hi, how'd your day go?
And you got an invitation.
Your kidding me. What is it a big party or something?
We have to start looking for a shrink.
Of course I didn't.
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Groceries maybe? A package?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
I just heard them Karl.
Karl!!
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
No. It wasn't me. I didn't.
That's good.
Never.
The shaking of the bed, that's doubtless due to musuclar spasms.
Are you sure?
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
Oh yeah, since when?
Why, I don't understand?
Like what?
I thought you were supposed to be an expert.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
It's not important good night.
Please.
What?
Father?
You know how?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
So something please Doctor, Help her!
Honey this is Father Dyer.
A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
Heathcliff, Jackie Gleason, and in the role of Catherine Earnshaw, Lucille Ball.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
Intensely.
You and us.
Uh Huh.
Bon Jour.
La plume de ma tante.
Tseirp a si eh! Eno on ma I! Eno on ma I! Ahhhhhhhhhhh!
Merrin! Merrin!
Amen
No we haven't met, but they said I could tell; that you looked like a boxer.
Always.
From the psychiatric end.
Couldn't it of happened on the fall.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Come on!
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Be silent!
Yes.
Sometimes.
Who is it?
Is it Captain Howdy?
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
They're falling out.
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
Oh.
Get your hand off me.
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
I thought maybe held gotten over that.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
It was an accident.
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
What d'you say, Willie?  Tighten her up?
No, I mean it.
This time you gotta go.
Says who?
Your older brother.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Her hands.  Like that.
We don't get a gig.
Something came up.  Don't worry, Charlie stayed true.  Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
The trees.  The flowers.  Nice.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
That how you see it?
That's what we agreed.
It never was.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
It's early.
Here, how's this?
That's what I figure.  Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know.  I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
Last?
Right.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
I love you.  I just wanted to say it.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
Time flies, huh?
No. Why?
Huh?
Celebrating.  Join me?
He was just having fun.
What?
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie?  We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
You don't know?
It's a disease, Jack.  We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
No, it's not that.  I ... can't drink from the bottle.  I ... gag.
No, we're not.  Jack?
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
Well, that's fine --
My watch is broken, too.
So if I'm so 'late how come you're still here?
Hey!
Come on.  We don't have much time.
Okay, okay.  Here, how about this?
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Wow. You ever see her again?
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera.  God, we were just kids.  That was something, wasn't it?
They must've bought the same map we did.
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here.  So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
That'd be me, sir.  Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
Is that important?
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Right.  Bring him back.
All right.  Hold on.
Is that the way it is?
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
The Stratford.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Every year.
Aren't the kids asleep?
Nothing.
You were good.
Ed? How many people live here?
Long story.
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Frank wasn't 'there.
So how's the cat food business?
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
No shit. It's the goddamn water. Kill an ox. I buy bottled for my Danny. You can't trust the taps.
Another five years, huh?
Is that what you used to do?
My days are not the old days, genius.
Oh?
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
I'm not much for sweets.
Eddie.
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
An NSA surgeon gave me Castor's face.  He handled the transplant, the vocal implant, everything.  But somehow Castor came out of his coma -- and killed everyone who knew about the mission. But not before he was transformed into me.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Archer cut him a deal for turning state's evidence. He's free.
You always call me Miss Brewster.
Obviously someone else knows it!  Get everybody back to their posts -- NOW!
You better get used to it. That bitch Lazarro is getting kicked upstairs. Guess what white-bread family man is going to replace her?
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Like I fucking care?  I'm not just sitting here!
Just following your example.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
I'm not going anywhere.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Ooh, my suits are ready...
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
So you left her?  Just like that?
Im sure you do...
Like what?
I dont think so.
Kates my wife...
She is relentless.
She wants to have an affair with me.
It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
Look, maybe Im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  A little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here.  The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor.  You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we couldve been really good friends...
Ive got all the time in the world...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
A lucky streak, huh?
Brought what on myself?! I didnt do anything!
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...
As long as it takes to figure it out.  Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Figure it out?  Figure what out?!
Get out!
It would help me if we were.
Uh huh...
I know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
Trust me on this Kate.  I really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
No, shes not.
Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  Cmon, take it off.  Well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
How do you even know about this place?
I think it may help us but theres a slight chance it could make things worse.
No.  Well, maybe a few things.  But mostly just different...
Thats a big one for me, too.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
What are you sure about?
Its like a museum.
A perk for what?
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
Youve been Jack Campbell.  And thats always a good thing...
Please, just promise me youll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you dont, then its like it never happened and I dont think I could live with that.
Dont worry about it, Jack...
To Paris. Paris, France.
Dont get on that plane!
A shelter?!  Im the richest guy in the building...Ive got twice the square footage you have!
That's because I'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
You suddenly having trouble getting dates?
Hey, are you okay?
Of course I did.
Christmas?  It cant be Christmas...
Ben, the money's not important.  We could <u>save lives</u>.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Ben.  Are you okay?
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God?  Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp.  Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Give me the god damn mirror!
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
About me?  How sweet.
Oh, he did.
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
What do you mean "complete"?
The Center for Disease Control.  If this thing is contagious --
You've been working out.
But all these people...
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
Let's not jump to conclusions, we need a <i>massive amount of evidence</i> before making that leap.
Are you kidding?
You <u>need</u> a doctor.
You can't leave them out there.
Just <u>find</u> him.
Same old Reed.  All analysis, no action.  Wasn't that the problem with you two?
Medical's ready.
I know that. But what's the maximum?
It'll be close -- but there's still a margin of safety.
The Pentagon, wasn't it, General? Only you weren't in that uniform...
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Sorry, but I'm rusty on surgeons. Who's the girl?
Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
You mean <I'm> going along?
As part of the Crew.
Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
Yes?
Can't remember?... What do you mean?
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
But big enough for us...
He certainly is. He should be up and about in no time.
Not now. We need air, not greetings!
I can't till the hatch is flooded!
A great deal more than that, I believe...
What gives you that idea?
You're not the first, but he's much too innocent, much too involved with his work, to realize what's going on around him.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Dr. Duvall I insist you test the laser.
You left something out.
What's that?
We have no alternative. With only six minutes left, we'll just barely make it.
I'm going to do what I can to save Benes.
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Isn't there another route? So we can by-pass all this?
"Proclaiming in incandescent glory The myriad Mind of Man..."
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If there's any chance --
Fasten yourselves in. There should be a tremendous surge when the Heart starts up again.
We're safe -- long as it remains that color...  We're in the Pleural Sac.  It keeps the Lungs from rubbing against the Wall of the Chest up there. When those membranes become inflamed, we wind up with Pleurisy -- and a wracking cough.
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
Sorry, but the situation has changed.
Where we going?
And she said it was indelible...
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
We can get out through the Lab Section.
Nothing wrong with us! Not a thing! We're fine -- just fine!
The Wall's transparent...
What do you mean?
Fluid is seeping through. Better come down and have a look!
I am through fucking around! Drop that fucking briefcase!
Fuck you, man! Where's Jerry? I gave SIMPLE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS -
I don't know. Few munce.
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
What're you, nuts? We had pancakes for breakfast. I gotta go somewhere I can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  Not more fuckin' pancakes. Come on.
Whoa, Daddy.
Okay.
Blood has been shed. We've incurred risks, Jerry. I'm coming into town tomorrow. Have the money ready.
...The heck d'ya mean?
...Yah, well, you stay away from Scotty now -
Well, okay, I'll talk to my boss...
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
Yeah!
Okay. Well, that's why we don't want ya goin' out fer hockey.
What's the next step here, Jerry?
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Sir? Right now?
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Okay, because if I can't correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then I gotta call back that money -
I mean send it over. I'll shoot it right over to ya.
What the - how's Jean?
Yah.
Shep said 8:30.
Okay.
Whatcha watchin' there?
Norstars.
...There's a million dollars here!
Well, that's okay, he's a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I'm not worryin'. I just, I was wonderin', see, I gotta get in touch with 'em for, I might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
Yah, well, see, I did that, and I haven't been able to get 'em, so I thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
Margie. Thought you might need a little warm-up.
Oh, yah?
So I got the state lookin' for a Ciera with a tag startin' DLR.  They don't got no match yet.
Yah.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Yah, that's me.
I'm sorry, Mike.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
It's okay...
Nope.
Yah?
No.
Linda Cooksey?
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Three-cent stamp.
I love you, Norm.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Oh, my.
Well -
Right, right.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
And the second rule about it is... you're not supposed to talk about it. And the third rule...
You are?!
Yes.
"Abuse" the copy machine.  There's an image.
I Am Jack's Complete Lack of Surprise.
What about this?  Keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  In exchange for my salary, I'll keep my mouth shut.  I won't need to come to the office.  I can do this job from home.
This is... really a shock...
Well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  In the meantime, don't leave town.  I may need to bring you in for questioning.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
What?
A year?  How'd you manage that?
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
I found a new one.
This could go on for hours.
Worth every penny.
Here.
Really... I mean it.  Have you been going to your groups?
Do you care?
I don't know.
It was the smart move on her part.
Can I come in?
Is that what you're calling it?
I'm sorry, I...
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
I can't let myself see where you're going.  Go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
I star-sixty-nined you.  I never pick up my phone.  What's up?
Excuse me?  "Throwers?"
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
I mean -- for a living.
How's that working out for you?
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
All gone.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
The things you own, they end up owning you.
What's that?
In reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there's the flash of Tyler's contribution...
A nice, big cock.
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Is it?
I know that.
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
What?
If you could fight any celebrity?
Hey... don't knock librarians.
She'd invaded my support groups, now she's invading my home.
You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
Work.  Going to work.
Look...
What are you doing?!
We are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  We are all part of the same compost heap...
You choose your level of involvement. I won't make decisions for you.
If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
Why do people think I'm you?
Why do people think anything?
What... ?
You took me to the house.
What about Marla?
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
What?
Defuse the bomb, please.
Yes.
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
Very good, Sir.
Really?
"Stuff."  Were the mid-terms hard?
What did you want to be, Raymond K. Hessel?
No, please, no, God, no!
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
No, it's not here.  This one was different.  More like the pile up and the van going into the lake.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
That lucky bastard.
Good.  Cause we just got some new info and I don't need you getting freaky on me.
May we come in?
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
No, I'm good.
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
Who am I, David Blane?
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
What if Tod... is just the first... of us?
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Right. April 25th.
Nothing is... anymore.
Fuck you! I'll remove myself!
It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
But I saved him. I intervened. Just like the plane. That's the design.
Because of you, I gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "Stepmom."
Me, right? That's why you're not saying.
I'm not afraid! I DECIDE WHEN IT'S TIME! I control my life! I control my death!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
That's right, buddy.
What's that?
Put it in the guard's barracks.  Man they got pissed.  They beat the crap out of me, but... it's kind of a tradition.  You oughta see 'em run around.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Where's your stuff?
Yeah.  Dinky-dau, that's me.  Hey, Co.  You wanna meet Jake the one- eyed snake?
Alright.  Home run.
Nothing we can do, man.
Duck soup.
Crazy motherfucker.
Huntington Beach, California.
Typical...
Look, Colonel... we're all adults here.  This is a war.  A very quiet, very intense war.  People get sacrificed.
Of course not.  You can't get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after Tehran.
I could a couple of days ago.  Gonna be... stiff.
That's it.  My life.
Plus, what else?  Two Silver Stars, four Bronze Stars, two Soldier's Medals, four Vietnamese Crosses of Gallantry and... uh, a handful of Purple Hearts.
You just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
Meeting ... people.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
I'm paying you.
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
He just needs some clothes?
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner.  Say!....Anybody up for Chinese?  Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
You'd have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it wouldn't be the best thing for him. He needs hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. I wouldn't feel responsible in any way. There's really nothing you can do. I'm sorry.
Yeah, well... I let him stay there. What else could I do after such a tragedy?
He's not here.
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
No...no...we can't...we can't..
I... I was just leaving.
People spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  It's not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Which ones?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Tonight!  How's tonight?
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry?  Breakfast?  A fruit pie perhaps?
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
Fifty dollars?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
Yes. I think that's very fair.
What?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
You won't be alone for long.
I never say anything I have to.
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
No.
Divorced.
No.
No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through...
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I hope they do.
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Is what you?
If you can't do what I ask, Ray, use that money to go back home, then.
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Okay...
You got any change?
Fill it up.
What do you mean, you don't have side orders of toast? You make sandwiches, don't you?
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Don't, then.
Everybody still up on the Island?
Carl's a fiddler. What's he doing coaching piano?
I know.
Well, I'll be seeing you in a couple of days, won't I?
It's not that bad.
No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Uhm hmm.
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
Playing piano all day and then jumping into cold water. You could get a cramp.
Thank you.
I was really very moved by the way you...
Up to now, what I've been getting from you are meaningful looks over the dinner table and a lot of vague suggestions about the day after tomorrow...
Yes.
What?
I'll be back later...
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Catherine...
That's what I mean...
All right, let's have a rematch.
Robert, let's not be rude, okay?
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
No, I wouldn't.
Not dirt. See, dirt isn't bad. It's filth. Filth is bad. That's what starts maggots and riots...
You better hold onto your tongue!
Well, you're not that bad, but some people... I mean, people's homes, just filth. I've been in people's homes...
In my personal thing, I don't see that. I'm seeing more filth. A lot of filth. What they need to do every day, no, once in a while, is a cockroach thing, where they spray the homes. And uh... can you imagine, if their doors were painted a pretty color, and they had a pot outside, with...
Why you have an attitude for?
Is it true?
I just wanted to see you.
You got a boyfriend?
I buy them flowers.
Well, you know I'm standin' here and you say I look good?
Wussup, Victor.
Yo, can I talk to you for a minute?
I'll be right down.
What you want with her anyway'
I think he's 18 or 17.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Not really.
Unbelievable.
Sonofabitch.
Creasy, how old are you?
Nineteen.
You don't have to run with me, Crease.
What? What are you talking about?
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
What'll it be Fletch?
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
No idea.
For sure?
Thought so. What for?
I'm fine.
Doctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. He was quite surprised that you fainted.
It's all right. It wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
Yes, right away.
He'll be so relieved.
I agree.
Pretty hefty. Keep reading.
My parents were great fans of the former President.
Come on in.
Oh, about ten days ago.
Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy.
I know.
I know. I got bad luck or something.
What's that?
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Twenty years.
That's Brazil.
Because we can't.
Nugent. Ted Nugent.
Come inside.
I don't feel sick. Not yet. They tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. After that... well, I'd rather not be around for it.
Did it ever occur to you that I might not want to kill you?
I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off.  These will be open.
Where am I going?
Sure.
Shoot.
That's one thing I did find. It's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
His bride. Cute as a button.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
I can't figure out why I went to Utah for the morning.
If I had a nickel for every one of Alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, I'd be a rich woman.
Long story.
Yeah.
I was afraid you'd say that.
I checked. There was no divorce.
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.
In her cabana, sir.
I would, actually.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
Very good, sir.
Frank, you look a little peaked. Wanna vomit?
Uh, almost.
Irwin...
You broke it? You know the source?
He's not the story! There's a source behind him.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
You'll have it.
Who's Frieda?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
I don't have a sense of humor, either.  Sorry.
But I am...
Damn, Ford, you're the most cynical man in the industry and that's not easy.
Man, ever since old Jack Grendel died, Julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  Not only am I producing, he's got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  What are you looking at...
'Bye Ford...'  Hey, let me cheer you up.  I found the IN X S payment.
Rock stars!  I'm going out of my mind.  All I get are perks.  I don't make money, I make gifts. How am I supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  I want cash.  Moulah.  Wampum.  Dead Presidents.  Andrew Jackson. Gerald Ford.
Quit crying.  I think we've got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
Spooky.  I'll process her.
Cool.  Jazz, meet me at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion tonight. I'll have a ticket for you at the door.  Some concert.  Could be interesting.  Dress nice.
Hello...  It's Colleen.  With answers.  She wants to meet.  Down.  Way down-town.  Late.
Without Grendel knowing about it. B-I-N-G-O and Bingo was his name-O. Counterfeit C.D.s.  Tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
Three hundred.
Because I know rock-n-roll.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
What a perv...
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Ye-ah.
Ye-ah.
I'll mail you a letter, come on!
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
These two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  I think Armani.  They were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... I did what you would have done.
Liar!  You don't care!  About anything.
Why shucks, Lt. Anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
Disco Ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
Like me.
God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody.  Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
Whatever you're getting paid, I can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
Case closed, okay?  Thirty seconds.
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
You gotta be kidding!  This is unfuckingbelievable!  I have to start the evening crawling down Capital Records, I shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  Next up, my guitar! The second most important thing I own and now it's toothpicks for the homeless on Hollywood Boulevard!  Then, then, after I burned up your brother, Jazz... I should say as a fucking footnote I've usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out Domino's Pizza's phone number and saying it's mine... Tonight was different. I felt respect.  I felt love.  Then Jazz left me... and <u>now</u> I get to die!
And if I told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
Fuck me...
You're a poet and didn't know it.
Only on a first name basis.
It's my daughter, man.  I know I never told you about her, but God, I love that girl.  She calls herself Zuzu Petals and she's been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is L.A. A fucking groupie partying with the pros.  You have to get my baby back, she's my pride and --
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
I hope you solve the case and I know you will, because you're the best.  Ford, guys like you don't grow on trees.
No. 
What?
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
It's yours too!
Il est en retard.
What happens to the schedule?
But will they?
It was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  The arch is still the largest in the world.
He got off on six.
Perhaps he's visiting a guest.
Yeh?  Who else?
Marseilles.
Yeah.  In the late innings.  Ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
Whip it out.
Toy wit' this will ya.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
We put him to bed for the night.
What is that old building?
For garbage?
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
Nicky Moore.  Patty Ryan.  Mary Finelli. These names mean anything to you, asshole?  Julia Sullivan!  She mean anything?  She means something to me!
I'm alright, Gibby.
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
He ain't the only one.
Luck, my ass.
No.  This isn't what you think.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, I'm scared.
Pal, my whole life's an emergency.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
Look pal, I'm just askin' how you...
I'm not dreaming.
What?
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
1998.
I think I'm losing you.
It's okay.  I'm still here, Chief.
Fire.
Yeah, it's me.
She just died, your mother just died?
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
I don't know, John.  I'm a fire fighter. This is...this is different.
How?
I'm right here, Dad.
Yeah, I think so...
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
In my pocket.
Dad, you there?
Yeah, lung cancer.  Ten years ago.
You got a deal, mister.  I mean Santa.
Whoa, I just...I just...
She's pretty special.
Are you a good cop, John?
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
I did?!  I broke the world's record.
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
I vote for the hammock.
What do you mean?
And, what about us?
I'm here with you.  Can't that be enough for now?
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
You're Shelly?
Why don't you help us?
Gulp!
Stop worrying.  I don't think they'll bother to come after us.
Maybe.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Look at it this way... things can only get better... Right?
You're wrong.
Go out and plug the cord back in.
Well, who told me to take this cow path?
That's it.  We're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
I wish it was.
My ass.
Daddy, what is going on?
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
Nancy.
Why?
Yeah, we're here.
Will you listen, dammit!
Yeah.  Jason murdered them and...
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
So let's talk.
Save your...
Yes.
Twenty.
That's it, we're done.
Do you have to ask?
It's...It's all right.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
I was going to, I was going to tell everyone.  I just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  Is Steven around?
Yeah.  Sit down a second.  There's something I need to tell you about Steven...
I'm now begging you.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
I'm gonna get your outta this.  Just hang tight.  Okay?
I've told you the truth.
I didn't kill her!
About Jessica.
That's a lie.  Diana would never talk to you about Jessica.  Not after what you did to her.
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
No. And I'm not losing any sleep over it.
He bought you that?
What are you going to do?
My parents are open minded about that sort of thing.
Relax, I've got McCulloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.  Rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...
The fire alarm...
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
Oh, I can see that. You've done a wonderful job of supervising the kids, Miss Van Deusen.
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
I'm staying.
She didn't push me into coming.
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
This isn't a request.
Just felt a little chill.
Maybe not. But you're not telling me everything, are you?
Give me the degrees first, followed by minutes and sec...
Very big.
Ruptured steam pipe.
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
You used to love life. You don't exude this any more.
That's awful.
Do we care?
There are things that speak to us from the past.
Keep going west. Last building before the river.
Does it feel comfortable?
About what?
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
This is how we've managed to last.
Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
First you tell me.
Yes.
You smoked because I smoked. We were falling in love, remember? I used to see certain movies only because you had seen them. I wanted to see what you saw.
We did it in the office. She thought her apartment was too impersonal.
One more out.
A thousand things.
It's me. Nicky.
If it's you, what are you doing here?
It's all connected, Pop. It's one life. Baseball is memory. How do fathers and sons show their love? They go to a ball game together. Thirty-five years later, they sit in the kitchen and remember.
Let's not start that again.
You're suppose to wear it when your back gives you trouble.
How come you got the kid with you?
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
I've had three straight washouts, Sidney.
Eleventh inning. What else?
You're not making sense.
Sidney.
I have excellent long-term memory.
Mine was cobalt blue.
I kissed her while she was laughing.
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
Oh. You know him.
And he has finer moments now and then.
So do I. Over and over.
No one's waiting.
In this place there are no untouchables -- and no work is beneath any of us!
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
I expect you to show as much patience as I am now.
I -- I mean it's all right. It doesn't matter.  I'm -- my name is Andrews, Charlie Andrews. I've come from India -- I've read a great deal about you.
Going nearer to God!
Oh, I've been a Gandhi buff for a long time.
You will respect the law.
A great deal.
I dined at the prison.
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
Who's leading them?
I will prove it to you.  Come swim with me now, Vincent.  Now--tonight.
I like football.
I'll see what I can do.
--What <i>about</i> his profile?
Since going underground, traces of this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  Do you need any more than that?
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
Often.
Surely you know what you have.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
Jerome--?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me.  Are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Will you be okay?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
I have to caution you it's not fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
German, is that you?
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
I've found him too.
You celebrate, Jerome?
Why would I be angry?  It was beautiful.
Let's walk.
It's not safe.  I shouldn't have brought you here.
Hard to judge how these things happen. The Parole Board almost never reverses their decisions.
I get my own help.
You run the job, but I run the show. You got two weeks to set it up.
I heard about you. You work with Miller.
I'll take care of my end.
A little more was taken out before.  My brother's a director of that Bank, Mr. McCoy... I had a few pressing debts.
Get it over with...
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
I've been there every day for the last four years.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
How's Estelle?
That's not all of it.
It's all right.
You got the parole, didn't you?
But I got you out. Didn't I, Doc. I did it. I got you out.
Nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. Local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. Only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. Get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. Then they're down to their side guns.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
He must have.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
I don't want to hear it.
I don't think we can any more... If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off...
I don't see how.
I'll be ready.
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Yeah.
Thanks. Hope you do too.
Two boxes of double-ought buck.
Two.
Wire pull over?
I 'm handling the fine stuff. You're back up all the way...
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Right.
He took the day off.
Can't leave the desk.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Why not?
'Bout five thousand.
Go with God.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
I got a nurse in mind.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
Cliff Brumby. He'd seen the film. He wanted to meet Doreen.
Did Eric know that Frank was my brother?
What's it got to do with you?
Well?
What?
What about?
Who sent you, Thorpey?
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
Nicer than most.
Yes.
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both!  He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday.  He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
Who?
Yes.
No, do you really?
Yeah, I'll do you a favour.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Yeah.
I mean, I was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  He was always on time.
Where would I find him?
My brother, Frank.
No. Really, I am.
Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
Yes, Edna, and I must say you've been great about the ...
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
What's that supposed to mean?
Not much.
No, I didn't know that.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
They do that up North.
Ha.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens to us all.
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
I'd never try to sell an Indian.
They came in and they, you know...
I...
...that's right...
Eh?
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
Yes.
The leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
Starting up.
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
What?
Huh.
We're not actually talking about it.
Not actually, no.
Did you talk to Graff?
He would take you on.  Yes.
They'll know when you go over to Graff...
Then listen to this: I have to get those leads tonight.  That's something I have to do.  If I'm not at the movies...if I'm not eating over at the inn...If you don't do this, then I have to come in here...
Why?
Yes.
They're ancient.
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
They stole...
They stole the phones.
Where criminals can come in here... they take the...
Down the street.
Why? 'Cause they aren't going to find the guy.
Where was I?
Was I?
No.
No, who?
I don't want to go to lunch.
That's what, that's what, that's what I was trying to do.  That's why I came in...I meet gestapo tac...
Levene!
Levene!!
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
Shelly, you blew the last...
It isn't me...
Murray...
You know what those leads cost?
Murray said...
...ah, fuck this...
That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You don't look at the fucking percentage. You look at the gross.
I'm out.
...they kicked out.
I can't do it, Shelly...
I have to go... 
Because I say so.
You want something off the B list?
The deal still stands, our other thing.
You're so full of shit.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
I...I'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
No, I don't think so, Shel.
Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to see the memos...?  They're nuts... they used to call in every week. When I was with Webb.  And we were selling Arizona...they're nuts...did you see how they were living?  How can you delude yours...
I'm sorry.
Eighty-two thousand dollars.
My ass.  I told 'em.  Listen to this: I said...
Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.
Mmm.
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
"Always be closing..."
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
Uh...
Twelve-fifteen.
No.  You said the one.  That's why you said we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.
I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll call you this evening, Jim.  I'm sorry you had to come in...Monday, lunch.
I think I'd better stay here for a while.
My wife...
I don't understand.
And when was that check cashed?
I told you.
She wants her money back.
She won't listen.
No, Jim.
To negotiate what?  To negotiate what?
I can't talk to you, you met my wife, I...
Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out today.  I'm going home.  I'm going home because nothing's accomplished here...Anyone talks to this guy is...
"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  You want to...
Your farewell to the troops?
Have a good trip.
...some of the contracts...Lingk. James Lingk.  I closed...
It went down.  I filed it.
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit. Fine. 
I'm leaving very early tomorrow, before you wake up.
No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration.
 He's going to kill Fanucci.
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
I got surprises for everybody!
Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna?
You're not my father!
Because I need MONEY!
It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen?
I hated you for so long, Michael; for so many years.  I think I did things to myself, to hurt myself, so that you would know -- and you would be hurt too.  But I understand you now; I think I do.  You were being strong for all of us, like Papa was.  And I forgive you, and want to be close to you now.  Can't you forgive Fredo; he's so sweet, and helpless without you.
 You're a good fellow.
Yeah, some deal I made.
Let's go.
C'mon, I see what I can do.
Oh.  Mikey, what's up?  I'm totally in the dark.
Me?  NO, no, I don't know anything. Fellas!  You're all falling asleep. We got to see Superman.
Mike, are you crazy, I'm your brother.
But, you told me yourself...
I was kept pretty much in the dark. I didn't know all that much.
I know.  That's why I brought you with me!
Talk to him.  Tell him how you feel.
Goddamn it, where were you?
No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name.
Alright.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
You know there's a Senate Investigating Committee recently set up; we thought it would be unfortunate if they were to trace anything though-provoking to your name.
Thanks...friend.
Very well.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Why don't you sit down?
I know what it meant... and I'm prepared to make it up to you.  I will make changes; I can.  I CAN change; that I have learned, that I have the strength to change... And we have another child, a boy... and you'll forget the miscarriage.
Get out of my hotel.
You talk about the baby.  She can have another baby.
I know that; but who gave the go ahead.
Very impressive.
Okay.  You know he doesn't have that kind of money.
Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family.
No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed.
Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him.
Trust me; do as I ask.
I know.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
I thought we would meet alone.
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate.
We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
Yes.
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
I didn't mean to...
You know, I just can't do that anymore.  I still have time to get things right.  Get married again --
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
Damn straight.  I'm sick of playing games.
The Master is waiting for you.
No.  No.  I am sorry.  Forget everything I say.  Here.  I will take the tray.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
I'm not going to hurt anyone.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
But I didn't do this!
They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt.
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
Broke is more like it.
Football in college.
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
Yes.  You were a Marine.
I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
No.  At least not in the legal sense.
Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.
Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you.
I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing.
In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed.
I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
Oh no.  I never swim.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
I told you.  I don't like to talk about that.
Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me?
Do I have any other choice?
I'd like to try again.  If you're game.
A very lucky thing indeed.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  Hey, I loved it too.  A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
You're planning a trip?
Oh Clayton.
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
Thank you.
You didn't, Jimmy.
Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
Right.
I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
I am such a goose.  I mistook you for Cecil Beaton.  It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
What kind of job... ?
Maybe she don't know. Although I don't see how that could be. Maybe she didn't want to upset you -
The point is: Kip's been living the life. Only he's a wild child. Crazy. Makes our old behavior seem like altar boy time. But he fungold this one so bad, folks around L.B. are already speakin' about him in the past tense.
Also, never underestimate the restorative powers of "Karaoke."
I do ...  Christ, what happened to us ?
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
And if he doesn't make it -- ?
Everyone know Ray Calitri? Pillar of the community ...
But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
Let them go --
You'll leave -- ?
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
Your girl works in there ...
What do you want from me?
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
Very good. Think you can get in without waking her up -- ?
Of course not. I'm Robin Hood. I take from the rich, and give to the needy...
Donny-nothin'!
Pop the trunk. I need my tool ...
We don't -- ?
You getting my checks ... ?
I got a message. I live at 1443 Locklin.
You've been pre-booked...
We'll take it...
Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
I can see that -
He's gonna kill you -- !
I can handle it --
De nada ...
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
I don't know. What -- ?
What?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Where'd you find this one?
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
Buy you a drink?
And you got some Italians -- ?
Hey -
They only made a handful. We're lucky there's even one living in the area...
No ... ?
Oh. Okay. Right.
Oh, God...
Hear you roar ...
I dunno. I know a place.
Is he still working here ?
The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
I appreciate your dilemma, Memphis. But how are two washed-up thieves and an old man supposed to boost 50 cars in three days...
She left...
So she flies -
She soars -
How come ... ?
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
Why you gotta front me like that? I'm talking to Kip --
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Son of a bitch. Get over here.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
I know what you did inside. You did what you had to do. I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking from now on, outside. I'm talking right here.
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
You're only home early because we got you a job, right? And I don't need any heat. You understand?
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
Nods again.
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
The bag with the envelopes.
That again.
What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman.  He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
Jezuz Christ!
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
With what?
She's beautiful.  Look at her. Henry, look at her.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
I got scared.
What?
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.
Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.
Nah.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
He says he's too hot.  He doesn't even know I came here today.  It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
Guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. Just then there's this fuckin' BOOM like fifty yards down the road. Some guy's car hit a tree.
Oh, Morgan!
All right, then.
Oh great, tell her that! Now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
--or a tail--
What are we gonna do up there?
Yah, but it's better than this shit. At least you'd make some nice bank.
It's a way outta here.
Chuckie, what are you talkin'...
Let me tell you what I do know. Every day I come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. But you know what the best part of my day is? The ten seconds before I knock on the door 'cause I let myself think I might get there, and you'd be gone. I'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. You just left.
No, I had to talk him down.
You caught that, huh?
I really don't know what to say. Look, I lie to women all the time. That's just my way.  Last week Morgan brought these girls down from Roslindale. I told them I was a cosmonaut. They believed me. But Will's not usually like that--
Fuck her.
NO SHE DIDN'T GET YOUR DOUBLE BURGER!! IT'S ALL FUCKIN' FLYIN' FISH FILET!!
What the fuck? I just asked you for a job yesterday!
Save it for your mother, funny guy. We heard it before.
Good, it was all right.
There's no problem. I was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. My contention is that prior to the Revolutionary War the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
It's touching me.
Down there.  And I'm nervous.
Maker can. This is not new, Gerry!
No, no. Nothing like that. I just need his name. TERRY I can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
I don't know what it's called.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
It's Saturday.
Since Nancy died.
Where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
Just meet with the boy once a week.
I won't talk first.
We haven't really gotten into it. LAMBEAU Maybe you should. My phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
--Ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
Do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
What did you think?
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
That's it isn't it? You married the wrong woman. She leave you? Was she bangin' someone else?
What? Do I wonder if I'd be better off if I never met my wife?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
When did you know she was the one?
Nobody gets what they ask for, Will. That's a cop-out.
It's not your fault.
Good luck.
What?
I kind of got that impression.
What?
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
Okay...
I was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...I'll take a kiss.
How many?
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
Not tonight.
You're rich. What do you have to worry about?
Instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? SKYLAR No, so I can be a doctor.
I guess so.
I know. I just do.
I can't go out to California.
What am I scared of?
--some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Watch me pass that Chevvy.
You're *ticklin' me!*
Oh.
What's it to you?
How many men?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Which way is House 25?
Joad. Tom Joad.
That's the way it is.
Say, who runs this place?
Government.
Can't promise you that, but there'll be a licensed agent here tomorrow mornin', if you want to talk to him.
Have a little snort?
No, I never. What?
I been in the penitentiary for four years. 
What you figger to do?
We know. But ain't none of our folks ever been buried without a few words.
I ain't gonna run.
What's the matter? What's happened?
Then what are you doin' this kind a thing for--against your own people?
You ain't gonna blow nobody nowhere. First place, you'd get hung and you know it. For another, it wouldn't be two days before they'd have another guy here to take my place.
Can't you see that sticker?
I didn't mean nothing.
Well, maybe. But I'd hate to be doin' it. Takes more nerve than I got.
Sure. We made a buck since midday.
Hush!
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
No plants.
You don't ever get scairt, do you, Ma?
Go get Tom an' Al.  I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
I'm ready.
Didn' you get no sleep?
Was Granma bad?
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Sure. Good-by.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
You can't get no loaf a bread for a dime. We only got fifteen-cent loafs.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
Ever'body got to get off. Ever'body leavin', goin' to California. My folks, your folks, ever'body's folks.  Ever'body but me. I ain't gettin' off.
They come. They come and pushed me off.
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Me an' you both.
Give 'im a fryin' pan. 
I ain't gonna fret you. Go on!
Maybe he'll be back. We'll leave word for him. Jus' don't cry. 
I wisht it was day.
I never knowed it! All I done was pull that string!
Now don't you go monk'ing--
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
What do you do?
You do not.
You're so funny...
I'm Martin Blank.
Never better.
Really?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
You met people.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
Is it something you've done?
It's something I do...
Jesus Christ!
I was leaving.
I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it.
No.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
Okay.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
Those all seem kind of related...
No...
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
They blame you for the compromise.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
I'll do it tomorrow.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
I spoke to your father the other day.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
I think I'll go see Debi today.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
Yeah...
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
No. You drove us here.
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
It is cocktail hour yet?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
Feel good?
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
The point was to love each other.
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
Oh. You didn't tell me.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
I didn't see it.
You're right. Good.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Exactly...
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
Tch. What are you --
The funeral's on Friday.
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
Doing what?
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
When are you coming home?
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
I wish I did.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Sounds like something Tom would say.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
Promise.
You too, Diane.
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
Ain't brain surgery.
Yeah.
Have you talked to Tom about it?
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I'm okay... I'm okay.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
I want to see Pilgrim.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
I wouldn't know what to do if you were on time.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
The number's by the phone.
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
How are you going to take care of the cops?
What is it with this guy?
...as they snoop onto us.
Yo, everyone check this out. Hey, what's the Da Vinci virus?
Dead?
Hmmm.
No. No one special.
How did you know that?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
And if I win?
Okay, thank you.
It's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
Thanks for your help.
You would have looked better.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Sorry, I can't help you, okay?
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
It's replicating, eating up memory. What do I do?
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
Yeah.  Should be on the road.
So?
So?
I am different, it's just that I just got pissed off...that's all.
What's going on?
Brady!
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
It's okay..it's okay.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
You know damn well about what.  You let them take it out of here.
I can see this is useless.
Four plus Myers.
How many bodies did you find?
Ready to go.  Who signs for him?
I can safely say that Michael Myers is now in your hands.
Do you love me Rachel?
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
Double scoops?
Yeah, hurry up.
Rachel!
Yeah.
Dad, what's going on?
I don't want to look pushy.
Making sure that no one can get in here.
Got it Ben.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
They didn't know what they were fighting.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Now you understand?
Huh?
I'm never smiling again. Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
Cute.
The guys think I'm too smart.
Sure, see you later.
He was watching me.
I brought it for Tommy. I figured making a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.
What's this big, big news?
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
I don't want to.
Totally...
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
YEAH?
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient. Hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. Death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. You can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
Well, she's totally not here.
Hi, Tommy.
Same time, same place.
Can we watch the monster movies?
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
After the Jack-O-Lantern.
I said, stop it! There is no bogyman. There's nothing out there. If you don't stop all this, I'm turning off the TV and you go to bed.
No! Do as I say.
Let's make more popcorn.
She's washing her clothes.
He'll barely be able to sit up.
The only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. When they start raving on and on...
Mmm?
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
You want to see some?
Oh, it's magnificent!
Oh, is that what it is?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Right.
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
Okay.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
But I'm seeing him.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
Is this your first job?
Uh-huh.
It does.
When did you first notice this?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all?  I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Are you okay?  You look-- You're sweatin'. ELLIOT  Yeah.  Yeah, I just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  It's probably something I ate.  I'll-I'll walk. You go ahead.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
...cannot go on the air.
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Ohhhh!
Where are you headed?
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Yes? LEE  A couple of blocks from here.  If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Yeah, sure. 
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
But not over me?
W-well, please be candid.  I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
Lee... uh...
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
No.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
I know!  I know!
No, she doesn't, either.  You've got tons as well.
I don't know.  Um...I'm just antsy.
But, you got four children!
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
I didn't say that.
Are you?
Get his wine away.
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
Lee...  you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with. 
Stop accusing me!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
But you don't have any symptoms!
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
No, I'm not dying now, but, but  you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right.  And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay.  I'm not going to go tomorrow.  But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
Okay.
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
I think we need to eat.
Huh?
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Oh!
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
...you know?  I, uh...
Go right over there.
Football!
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
Is there no chance?
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Now, Holly's not shy.
Oh!
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
Oh, what do they know?
No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
You're grateful, but you resent me.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Yeah, that's tough!  You don't deserve Cole Porter.  You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
Right.  Yeah.  I had a...
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
Oh, I'm fine.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Yeah.
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
I should have kept going.  I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
Really?
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
I am.  You-you made my day.
Oh, wow!
Oh.  You look so beautiful.
Dad!
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
A reward for what?
Why me?
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
...aren't you afraid of me...?
...they did it for a lark.
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
No, you're wrong about Verger.
I'm not.
I feel...  I feel they're Out to <u>Get</u> Me...
...these guy'll back you up.
I almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
Yeah, so where is he?
Somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for Information, so on.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
...then we won't need to tether Miss Starling as our lure.
Show me the Pigs.
OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.
No.  And...
I... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  To his appearance.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
Do you know the <u>seller</u>?
Oh, yes, what?  You'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
Come on, stay with us.  Look here:  I could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  N'I'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  What do you say...?  I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  I know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... Whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and I fix you up Right Now...  Whatsay?
..I was <u>instructed</u> that this was a Joint Task Force, the FBI, BATF, and the Mayor's Special...
Am I on that case, sir...? 
I am all attention.
What is that supposed to mean...?
Well, then, you have insufficient information.  I'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
You know it?
...how so?
That, that was <u>business</u>...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
...yes.
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
I'll have them picked up.
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  Back.  <u>Back</u> from America.  To your New Wife...  You have given it to her, and some of...  Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  Lucky man.  Lucky man, indeed.
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
I've left my <u>program</u>...
Yes.... yes...
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
...tell them...
Is it necessary to know?
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
What is that that smells so wonderful.
He saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
Well.  <u>Excellent</u>... I'm...
No.  I want to buy a dog. 
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
It's a <u>joke</u>.  You're a joke.  You're a joke.  You don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  That is the fine limit of your ambitions...
Thirty thousand dollars reward.  In the whereabouts of Il Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
....that's right.
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
What is your point?
...yes...?
Because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    Ah.  And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
Yeah...Are we going to do it or what? I still haven't packed.
And this Peepers was your...dog?  If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
It's about time. Isn't Fun great?

Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
You know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
Not now, Wendy.
"Wichita"--The guy every boy wants                          ] to be and every girl wants to hold.                         ] You're the love of my life and the                          ] end of the world. Cheers.                                   ]
It's not my style, okay?
Hey, don't run away now.
What are you talking about? She hated you! You hated her!  What are you smiling at?
Ouch....the lunchtime poll. So what's the question?
Color me impressed. I thought you grew out of Betty Finn.
Come on you jerk. You know you used to have a sense of humor.
Yeah, maybe.
You're not funny. Ouch!
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Uh-huh.
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
Then let's just concoct ourselves a little hangover cure that'll induce her to spew red, white, and blue.
Chick-en.
This is the last thing she'll ever write. She'll want to cash in on as many fifty-cent words as poss.
Neat. Let's try it out on J.F.K.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
Nag, nag, nag, nag. nag.
What in the hell do you think I'm doing? Taking out her tonsils?
Like father, like son. A serious-as- fuck bomb in the boiler room that'll set off a pack of thermals upstairs. Okay, so let's start by slowly putting the bomb down on the ground.
I still got to talk to Heather, dude. Weird funeral, huh?
May<u>be</u>.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
Is it hurting, dear?
breaks down into heavy sobs.
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
Can I go now?
is very angry.
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
stands and walks toward the door.
Love, you can still write to each other.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
You mean travel by ourselves?
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Pitbull attacks.
You just made that up.
I did more then that.
What was it?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday?
Really? Do tell.
Serious as a heart attack my friend. I think she literally fucked me brains out.
Ambrose. I know.
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
What's the difference?
I saw her drowning inside the car, detective.
Please, Gwen. You're- you're all over me.
Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on?
You've been cheating on me haven't you?
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
Never to put you in my will.
Okay then. Here's the scoop.
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Where is she? Where is my wife?
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Music to my ears.
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
Hey even if it is more power to ya.  Alrighty then. Have a good time.
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on...
What's the big deal?  You decided to pretend you were me.  A little moment of weakness, right?  So I sorta swiped her purse.  I got feet of clay too, bUddy.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
I don't need to be a hero, LaPlante, but I can't face people... the looks in their eyes... after the trust they gave me!
That's good enough for me.  You better take that "letter" there and get rid of it.
I know what he means.  I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day.  I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake!  Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator.  You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
Yeah, I been calling in sick.  They think I got the flu.
How recently?
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse.  The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Business thing.  Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
You in business with those guys or what?  I wouldn't want a problem for the establishment, Bern.
Ev, it's not my fault!  I'm trying to tell you this incredible --
How not all of them own apartment complexes, how not all of them play the stock market, how not all of them rent babies when they're panhandling.  He's ten years old, Bernie!  Impressionable!
Back to the jungle, Bernie.  Good night.
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
Were you in it?  In the war?
Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
There, like that.  Kind of, uh, sexy.  You can support me anytime, John.
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
The Presidency.  The public loves him.
What's "cynical"?
An hour after...!  Deak, for Heaven's sake!  Let's give her a night in New York City.  We'll put her and her boyfriend up at a good hotel...
Safety?
How are they with kids?
Friend, that animal will go after whoever's approaching the sound of that whistle.  And God help whoever it is.  Because that dog will not let up until there's dead meat on the ground.  Put your faith in that, pal.
Let's watch some TV.
Well, it's for a woman.
It's great.  It's clean and airy and quiet -- there are trees and flowers.  There's still some fixing up I have to do, but it's coming along.
Well, I've been doing a little independent contracting, some carpentry here and there, y'know, do-it-yourself-type stuff.  I still find it very soothing.
So, you're just kind of a roving --
Oh, that's fine.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
Not me, I fell for it right down the line.  Be a good girl and believe all the fairy tales.  He married me because I was pretty.
Listen, I'm sorry, but it's really late -- you don't have to come tomorrow to work on the floor.
Bye, Neil!
Uh huh.
Have you just plain asked him?
I've tried to get him to agree to one.  I just -- I don't know... I'm getting such weird vibes lately.
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Honey, nobody buys a house overnight -- if someone else comes back at them, well, we might have to make a counter offer.  But we can't look too eager or we'll get screwed.
Honey, the meeting today is going to be fine.  Don't get in an uproar.
I'm <u>fired</u>.  I'm unemployed.  Is that your idea of negotiating from a position of strength?  Clearly any potential employers have been warned to back off!
"Honey, I'm a zombie, I don't know whether I'm coming or going."
Philip, what are <u>you</u> doing here?
There's always an excuse, isn't there?
It's fun.
What did the thermometer say?
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
You can believe what you want.  You saw the tape.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
This ties in with Nash.
I think it was England.
Around.
It's late.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
The days of magic are ending.  The world is changing.
Perhaps -- but if I must face it, let it find me, for I shall search for it no more.
Are you always this pleasant?  You know what you're problem is?
Maybe myself.
Not long.  We should arrive in the morning.  Are you going to be alright?
She's the King's cousin.
It's done.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Your life.
Because it's the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
What do you want?
To talk to you.
In the highlands?
A lucky guess.
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
It's mine.  It's been in my family for years.  It belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
Meet me Tratino's at nine.
I know.
Not unless they're immortal.
On the back it has--
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
It will not end tonight.
I'll no forget you.
And I you.  Go now.  Let me walk to heavens door alone.
I don't know.  He is the stronger one.  He has a power--
I haven't lived life -- I've hidden from it.  I've existed in the shadows.
Good afternoon...  ... Shirley.
Alright.  It's going to take a few minutes.  I have to call and verify the funds.
I guess so.
Get to work.
I want a message sent:  No fuckups allowed.
Robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
Because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
I was <u>there</u>, Dennis!  I <u>saw</u>!  It's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
I want a helicopter to take us to Mexico.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
Keeps to himself, more like.
Okey-doke.
Fuck that!  You think I'm crazy?!
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
That big asshole nailed my windows.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
We can't make the microwave work.
We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
Stop it.
Mars?  What are you doing?
I don't see why you can't just lock me in.  It's not like I can go anywhere.
Ain't gonna happen.  We've got unequal pupilation.  He could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
He didn't say.
Then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  Mickey, you up?
Go, Chief.
I know the one.
Did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
They've been in there all day.
He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
Gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
I'll be back.
Yes. With some re-inforcements I'm confident we could impose order.
What's happening?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Where is she?
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
I don't understand.
They're only taking the whites.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
I can't. I have nothing left to bribe with. Can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
The front gate would be best, General.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
I am strong, Paul, like a lion.
You said you had no whiskey.
Please, I have money. They're driving into an ambush, it's on the radio.
The finest, and cognac, champagne. Come and I will get them for you.
Your police are at the gate?
If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
We cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
Thank God.
Gregoire, what are you doing here?
Please, except my humblest apologies...
The fog is too heavy, sir.
Good for you.  We're having a little trouble, Paul. We booked five rooms, but...
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
Why sir?
No blood. As I left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. I went to her house. She has the little girls. They are safe.
How do you know?
I will give you my house.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Your brother's here?
What?
I couldn't help.
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Murdered! By whom?
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
Give him time.
To Rutagunda's place. It is close by.
You cannot go alone.
That is why they call it coach?
Maybe. But in business class there are fine wines, linens, Belgian chocolates.
On the street.
You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
And what's Steven's status?
"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
Not yet.
So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
-- bullshit --
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
It was on my Dad's list of "things to do." But the House did him first.
Oh dear.
More to the point. Where's our host?
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
Three times, to be exact.
Accidents. Fatal. Each of your prior wives, so we've been informed.
As a tumor.
And I think that's case --
I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
-- but I imagine we'll all be mutilated beyond recognition by then.
Did it work?
Yes.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
And we get this money when?
The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions?
Why not?
Let's try down here...
What about that other guy?
It's succeeding!
Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Oh, I think we're going to have several.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
And then what happens?
Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living.
Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you.
-- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young --
Good way to get your head blown off.
-- no more --
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer.
The lockdown thing.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
No, you don't want to go down there. I am going down there. And I'm going to find <u><b>reverse</b></u> on this thing and floor it.
And you think it's in there?
Melissa...?
I did a cross search, death certificates with this address. James and Marion Foster.  They had a daughter.  Right here, it says James died, 1882, pneumonia. Marion dies September the next year. Suicide.
We'll have every leprechaun in Ireland here honey.
She talks to me.
Where is she?
Did you ever see a leprechaun?
The place is pretty dusty.
Must be...
Well something just happened to the power upstairs... Maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Good.  I'll start bringing things in.
Did you know her very well?
And you...are?
It will not take long...
So is that what all this is? Someone have a problem with us living here?
Not really.  Oh, wait a minute.
Well what is it!
Jesus Christ ...
You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here ...  ...
Correct.  The fields of France.  And many dead flowers ... Oh.  Forgive me. My name was Spenser.  Elliott Spenser. Captain.
No.  No.  It's fine.  Come now.  I was having bad dreams anyway.
Oh yeah ...
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
I know what you're saying but ... Never? You've never had a dream?  No, you know, you do.  You must.  What you mean is you don't remember them.
It's Saturday morning.  Let's go shopping.
It was part of a job-lot.  Some loony- bin they shut down.  Unclaimed stuff.
Don't do that!  Don't put yourself down. If you have a quality, be proud of it...
No.  Thank you.
Fuck you!
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
Because you want to.  You've always wanted to.  Look at your pictures.  Look at your sculptures.  Look at those tawdry representations and then ... Imagine.  Imagine a world of the body as canvas.  The body as clay.  Your will and mine as the brush and the knife. Oh, I have such sights to show you.
It has already begun.
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Hey, it has been known.  C'mon Terri, I'm not that bad a guy.  I have regrets. I'd like to put things right.  Don't tell me you haven't thought about me. Huh?
No.  But, as you can see, I'm having some work done on it.  You found a real treasure for me, Terri.  I hope I can show you how grateful I am.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
It doesn't have to be.  Everybody knows that if you mess with the Kremlin, you'll end up in a Siberian gulag eating your own fingernails.
Gum.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
You sound disappointed.
Anna, I think you better stay....
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
Too-do-loo, babe.
George, you promised.  No Old CIA/ New CIA jokes...
Quit bitching, you got the employee of the month plaque for that shit...Ah to be in Pari-is and in love.
You're supposed to be dead!
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
That's the best kind.  A wise woman once said "Polite conversation is rarely either."
Yeah.  The big E.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Question, sir?   His untiring pen predicted the airplane, the submarine, the bicycle, the helicopter, and even the tank.
Said.
I never break a date.  Scout's honor.
Uh....old badminton injury.
The C.I. what?  God, no...
Ooh, I guess I do know something Here's looking at you, kid...
Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
Trust Leonardo....
Actually he never told us what it was.
Baseball, why?
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
I guess that's a no.
The only thing you can't do is get sex for free.  I know I was in prison for like basically the 80's, but, call me daffy, aren't you supposed to <u>stop</u> me from committing crimes.  You know, Book-em-Dano, Call-for-backup, Give-a-Hoot-Don't-Pollute.
You certainly do.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Shucks.  Guess not.
I don't think you'll appreciate their choice of weenie.
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
Well, maybe I --
I'm plenty happy!
Yeah.
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
Please! Norville!
Oh, is that it!
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
...I'm sorry.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Never mind about that...
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
I filed it yesterday.
It's pure speculation! Why, they'd have my butt in a satchel!
Tell me about it.
I got big ideas, though!
Martinis are for squares, man.
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
-- tough titty toenails!
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
Yeah, tell me about it.
No kiddin', Bennie. I got gas.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
She's looking for her mark.
Plan two: Here come the waterworks.
She's damn good, Lou.
I didn't want to frighten you out of your sleep, Miss.  That's why I touched you farthest from your heart.
Doctors that are people can't cure everything.
Where?
Alive?
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
Wait. Don't draw any conclusions. Let me explain.
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
I asked you to let me explain. It's a long story.  And not an easy one --
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
That is good.  But I'd like to know more about the case.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
Mr. Holland?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Jessica was never any good for Paul.  You will be, you are.  And Mother -- seeing Jessica day after day -- never able to escape, never able to forget.  Please, Betsy -- it's only merciful.
Why should you be?  My wife is a mental case.  Please keep that in mind, Miss Connell -- particularly when some of the foolish people of this island start talking to you about Zombies.
But for Wes -- it must be a temptation to him.
You didn't drive her mad.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
That's past -- that's over and done with...
I'm quite sure nothing will happen, Doctor.
I did everything I could to forestall this, Paul.  I don't think there's any question of your innocence in the matter.  But there's been too much talk.  The thing's out of hand.
In Rhode Island with the folks. I'm a free agent tonight.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Yeah but Elena, even you don't believe all that "I'm OK. You're OK" stuff you keep babbling about -- you say so yourself. I've been all ears for about ten years now on his subject, and --
Good night.
What?
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
Oh, just dropping off a coffee cup. Jim left it, last time he was over. It was on the dash of the car. You were, you know, reading, thought I'd just catch some air. Let's eat.
What do you mean?
Elena, what are you're talking about?
Listen, Elena, if you're gonna pull that passive aggressive stuff on me again --
You're not going to --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Elena, you're just getting wound up to get wound up.
The phone's out.
Yeah?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
That's besides the point.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- What advice? You never --
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
Thanks for the advice Dave.
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
Hi Wendy.
It'll warm you up.
Of course.
I used to know how to cook.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
But not too ashamed.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
Paul, cancel your mental appointments, baby. What are you, like still stoned from last night?
Do what?
Groovy.  Young master of the revels, a treat for our hostess?
You notice anything with Mikey lately? The kid seemed a little out of it tonight, eh?
You going to tell dad?
No!
And I have a feeling for you too, because you're just like -- I feel for you like you're -- you're just like --
My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash.  Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
Geometry?
Wendy!
You get in trouble?
Charles. Have you been keeping out of my shit? Have you refrained from entering the sacred precincts of my room?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
Right.
Yeah.
Wants me to keep him posted on all your movements up here.
Too bad...
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature.
But there wasn't any...
How much closer would you say you were?
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop?  A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing.  A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him.  You said that once, remember?
I wish I'd had the chance to get to know him better.  Take him fishing or something.
That boyfriend.  Randy.
Even the best make mistakes.
No way.
What did he look like?
Kay Connell.  Did you love her?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
How should I know?...
Must be tough for you.  What happened.
I said you're going to get a phone call.
You're going to be brought in for questioning.
I was a mentor to her.
Yes.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
Who made us what we are?
None that I've ever known. I know nothing of God or the Devil, I have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. And as far as I know, after four hundred years I am the oldest living vampire in the world.
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
Yes... My God...
Yes I knew him. Knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
I can't save her.
You can't believe I'd leave without her. Armand! You must save her! You have no choice.
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
Is that supposed to frighten me?
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
He jests.
Why not?
It's only mortal death.
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
Fascination...
Yes. And I'm bored with this prattle --
I respect life, don't you see? For each and every human life I have respect.
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
That and more.
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
You remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
That's enough, cherie. Stop before the heart stops.
Are you mad????
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
And they frighten you?
You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
You can't look at them...
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Up-tighteous and self-righteous.
I know it, and it feels good.  Hi, Ty.
But, he said he'd try.
He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing!
I'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
Just kidding.
Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else.
Why are you being like this?
I just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. Like some critical piece is missing. Please understand...
This weekend?
You know me to well.
Ben Willis.
I told you.
I'm fine.
You don't seem fine.
He did something to the screen...it, it, said...
He's in it with Willis?
We had a connection, didn't we? I can tell you one thing, though. Ray didn't trust me. He was right. He's dead, but he was right.
Why? Come on, Julie. Think. You'll get it. Will Benson -- Ben's son.
Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Wanna drink?
Cool.
It is my home.  My name is Hugo Albrecht.
Why don't you stay here tonight? Get a good sleep. You can return to your command in the morning.
He's dead. I want the General to see him.
I'll go up and take a look at the General - perhaps sit with him.
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
You'd do anything to get Oliver away from Thea. But I'm going to stop you. I'm going to tell Mr. Davis exactly what you are.
I don't understand you.
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live - I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
Miss Wollsten - my secretary, she'd know.
What is her illness?
I will go with you.
I will be glad to leave this island. It has too much of that old dark world about it. I will be glad to leave it and that girl 
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
But that should make you like her.
In a way -- this girl, Thea. You must stay away from her.
Listen to what I say --
The General threatened me.
The groom, idiot. Come on, get that ladder.
Yeah, very funny.
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Well, naturally. Of course.
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
That's the kid.
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
They went out of business years ago.
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child  simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
When'd you see him last?
Yeah  old Joe College Wainwright, they call me. Well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
Oh . . .
Goodbye, Sam.
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
I own the house. Me, Giuseppe Martini. I own my own house. No more we live like pigs in thisa Potter's Field. Hurry, Maria.
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?
Hmmmm . . .
Nice girl, Mary.
Oh . . .
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction?  Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
You're not paid to be a canary.
Oh, George.
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
He's pretty young for that job.
I say, maybe you were born older. I suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
Do me a favor, will you, George?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
I know, but . . .
Some other time, George.
It's important.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Hello?
Yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
I'll take chocolate.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Ummmmm . . .
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
Don't you like her?
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . .  . . . Your what?
Where's your coat and hat?
Huh?
Oh, shucks . . .
I'm supposed to.
Someone pop your balloon?
Is she responsible for the punch?
Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
You're betting what you already got.
What the hell, we're steering for it.
Want to talk about it?
What is it?  What's there?
Positive I.D.?
Got it.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Pop.  I'm sorry.
All of us thank you, okay?
You're damn right that's what it is.
Do you?
Is there one in these waters?
Not when it's like this.  This animal has been ashore for 10, 12 hours, and drifting for a day, at least.  Every little nibbler in the sea's taken a bite.
Home it is.
Boat nut.  What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
Damn.
Yeah.   I think so.  Mike!  Keep it down, for chrissake!
That's great.
That you were fired.
We're alone.
Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
What?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
10-4,   soon as I can raise him.
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Yeah?  Then what?
Dad!  Dad!
Sure they did....
Now I really want to see it.
Me neither.
They tend to follow moving things. Maybe it's following Polo and Timmy.
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
I can go out if I want to.
I love it.
Maybe nobody will notice.  Let's get them back in the bus.
He thought he had a good reason.
Go on, you're tired.
Okay... Have them get it out of the tank.
I can get it.
Have you checked the bars?  The guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
It's his work.
I can't leave now.  We taking Sean out?
Just put your mask on.
Nothing.
... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
Make up your mind.
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
It's all right, baby.  We're safe...
No,  I'm not going through there.
What do you mean, we don't?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
Michael, you're not going down there.
On the telly.  We're to film him for the evening news.
Make this quick!
Well, we'll just try again, dear. Keep working on it.  Maybe you'll get it one of these years.  Pack up, boys.  Flipper's a flop.
No!
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Thanks for helping.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
We got it to live for ten hours. That's some kind of record.
I was seeing this guy off.  He flew in from Dallas.  Wants to marry me.  He's okay, but Texans are so possessive.
'Course they're also so rich.
Depends on big brother.
The one that goes underwater?
You're not in the water.  You're in a gondola.
Take it up.
He's diving!
It's disappeared.
Buzz off.
What the hell's there?
It's not closing, Mike.
That's impossible.
Got a job for me?
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
That's what grandmas are for.
Yes, you can make sandwiches....
It's time for tea, Grandma.
No way....
I'll be right there.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
Henny Youngman....
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
Spent it all on beer....
I'm still five....
The water's coming in...The water's coming in....
You could teach...You could....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
I'm your mother.  It's my job....
You must get bored easily.
Mostly it feels like driving.  You digging for buried treasure?
Doesn't matter....
Boss' day off...Take the wheel....
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
You're impossible....
That's hard to imagine....
There are...I'm tired of one-way conversations....
I have coffee in the thermos.
I'm too young for coffee.  Can I drive the plane?
Just like that?
She said it was coming....
Hell, no.  What kind of pilot do you think I am...?
Get her started....
Any faster and it'll turn into a flying Cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
I wish there was something I could do....
It was like having snow in the house ...Jesus, I miss them.
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
I made them, man....
I didn't do it on purpose....
Forget it....
We don't write up anything until we're done....
The shark will get it for us.
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
He gambles...He likes a good time...I see him around....
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
Mom....
The big picture...If we can't get him to swallow it, we'll shove it up his....
In a few minutes....
Who grows more beautiful....
I'm not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
Good night, Polly....
Yes, I'm gonna ride on the Shoot-the-Chutes. An' you know in the Dark Mill? Ever been in the Dark Mill?
Well, with me, it's all right. I'll kiss you and hug you. You see if I don't.  Now Mama, Mama, stop now. You're gettin' kittenish. Mama, listen, I'm gonna sing this like I will if I go on the stage. You know, with this show. I'm gonna sing it jazzy. Now get this ...
Watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. We haven't had a body in eighteen months.
I think you're here all day.
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
Find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." Send it to Sacramento, John .. I sniff grief ..
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
I think I got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - Last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
To throw out of the window.
We've fused into a major series, Ross. This girl isn't the second victim. This is "Jennifer <u>Eight</u>."
No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
John, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. The case is on its ass, you're closed.  C'mon, let it go for once .. Have a drink. C'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
I'm asking it.
What about Citrine?
Hey ..
Sucked in officers from all over the county. And it was the worst six months this station ever had.
It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
I want Serato ..  Why can't I have Serato?
Maybe he's lying to you?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
I've heard you call him Freddy.
No.
No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
No problem. I'm not in a hurry.
You should. It's wonderful.
No.
There's no one "looking at you" .. There's hardly anyone in here. The only person looking at you, is me.
I know, but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember. I was in the bad lands. Really not well. It's something that happens to a lota cops. We don't wanna talk about that.
No, Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry?
You know? How do you know?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
Sure you can. Anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
I'm here, honey. I'm right here.
Freddy's new obsession ..
Got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
Don't annoy me, Travis.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Go ahead.  Jump right on into my nightmare.  The water's warm. _ 65.
There is something missing here.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
It's all going to work.
I just got goosebumps.
Yep.  Have a good time at school, Ray.  Wish me luck.
Do you have something to drink?
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Bye you guys. _ 88.
Same to you.
Right.  I'll come in.
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Tell me -- let me help --
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
He's in the living room asleep.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
I'm sorry, I --
I gotta get back to Cushman.
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
Why not?
I understand your anxiety.
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
But how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
Great word.  Towel?
Rod, I'm not a rascist.  I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid.  It wasn't just about the money, was it?
What do you know about dating a single mother?
No, I don't know.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
I'm trying to talk to you.  How's your marriage?
You're jabbing at me. _ 112.
No, I'm going to answer you.  You want an answer?  I'll give it to you.  Loyalty.  She was loyal.  Everything grew from there.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Well.  Good luck with that --
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
That's when you need to cement, and define define define.
My husband believes in you.  We're gonna make it.  Bye bye Dorothy.
You okay?
No.
I'm scared.  What is it?
Shut up!!!
A few of us survived. A lot more died. And we were better prepared and better armed.  How many days have they been missing?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
What did you say?
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Three weeks. I had to rent some equipment.
It's a rapid prototyper. I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. It's the future of paleontology.
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Not with that sail.  Spinosaurus Aegypticus.
We should take it with us to signal any planes.
Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. You rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  You're no better than the people who built this place.
He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
Yeah.
What did you think?
You should.
No. I couldn't see.
Now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving without our son.
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
You are an academic.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
So what?
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Why wouldn't they?  Look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds --
I can't tell you.  But I'll be back within a week.
Very hurtful.  Your mother tell you to say that?
Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do.
To collect my fee.
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
I hadn't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk, but I only thought of adults, it never occurred to me --  You are a billion dollar idea, my little f-
There are no versions of the truth! This isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.
Dr. Juttson, please take Kelly back to camp right away.  Leave the other car for us and we'll meet you there in an hour or so.
So do it a favor and put it out of its misery!
What are they?
A statistical phenomenon.  Says everything in the world goes in streaks.  It's real, you see it everywhere -- in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets.  Once things go bad, they tend to stay bad.  Bad things cluster.  They go to hell together.
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
So the truth is more important to you than your life?
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
I'm her father.
These formations.  They're dried --
Can the kid walk?
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
How am I supposed to transport them?
I got an eighteen minute window.  Eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
Shhhhh!
The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves.  Violently, if necessary.
Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
Are you sure?
You won't be able to miss them.  Can't miss them.
Give time, they'll out draw the T-rex.  Guarantee it.
Control?!  You never had control!  I was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  So I made a mistake too.  I didn't have enough respect for that power, and it's out now.  You're sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. John, there's nothing worth picking up.  The only thing that matters now are the people we love.  Alan, Lex, and Tim.  And John, they're out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
Anything else, you old fossil?
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Small versions of adults, honey.
I know.
It simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  It's only principle is the Butterfly Effect. A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine.
I've never been a rich man.  I hear it's nice.  Is it nice?
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Tim.
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
Tim, are you okay?
I'm stuck.  The seat's got my feet!
Yes it is.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
And who in God's name do you think you are....?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
Let's get you out.
That's not what I'm going to do.  Good!
John, John.
Sure.
What if we fall?  I hate trees.
They don't bother me.
That's what I said!  You're a nerd!  They don't call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
Hey, smart-ass, I'm up here right now in a... luxury alpine retreat, with a two million dollar view of the lake.
And do you think they like the fact that half the country thinks Crystal Lake is filled with corpses?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
I really think we should go back...
Who is this? What's going on?
_Krueger_...
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Insomnolesence has been known to cause psychotic episodes... delusions...
It was Krueger, wasn't it?
I don't know... but I think he's pissed.
Krueger's the greater danger right now. We have to stop him.  _Springwood_. That's where he'll go. That's where he's always gone.	But Springwood's not like Crystal Lake. There's a couple hundred thousand people there. He could be anywhere.
And if he's not?
Ten minutes...
Up there.
What is it really?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
Yes -- we do.
I don't know what you could have read.
-- In what sense?
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
No, I left it in his office.
But <u>I'm</u> the messenger.  An error like this damages my credibility.
When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
I wonder if I might look to see if there's an address for family -- I thought I'd like to write to them.
Sorry, yes -- well -- thank you, sir.
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
What of it?
They're not obliged to tell.
You don't believe that.
Burgel doesn't like anybody!
He's jealous, yes, but <u>that</u> jealous?  He's too cautious.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
I told you, they're <u>dead</u>.  It's finished.
I know better than you what people will say when they have to.  When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Eight -- and seven months.
We know that.
... A piece of paper ...
It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
It's a factory in the northern mountains.  One of our best customers.  Without a proper request I'm not obliged to do this, you understand -- but I'll make an exception on this one occasion.
Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
Oskar.
You look tired.
Ludwig?
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
I photographed it extensively, father.
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
I tell you it doesn't exist!
Oh my God ... Ann?
Exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... That's what the public expect from a Carl Denham picture! Lead us into the mountains, Sir!
Yes?
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
Now there's a picture I'd like you to --
We don't want to just lock him up; we want a conviction, we wanted him to do something more.
You said that.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
Mm.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Well --
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know --  -- too bad? Pathetic?
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
But if it's someone else I do.
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
You're going back?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
I don't think so.
What?
I better keep looking.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
Yeah.
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
I wanted to give it to you first.
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Oh sure they try. The idea of a better life.  But they don't really know much about life: They get confused -- or scared or frustrated or bored -- they pop back to the one thing they can handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life, not love, not even real sex -- it avoids all that. Just the trick, the transaction.
I know Tom Grunemann.
Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed?  -- indicates no -- Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or peculiarities? --
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Everybody's got some, I guess.
Trask --
Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of course you're entitled, and there's some very competent --
Does that distress you?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
What do you like best about your daddy?
Tell me, does your daddy ever hit you?
In real life when does he hit you?
Greatest...
Wow!  French toast, really?
That's right.  You're absolutely right...It's been a long time since I made French toast.
Will she pick me up after school?
C'mon, there's not much difference--
I hate it.
You don't hate it.  We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine.
I love you...
Sure.
Yep.
No, she never did.
Uh, huh?
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Where will my toys be?
Will you come and say good-night to me every night?
Overruled.  The witness will answer, please.
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?
No, I did not.
Look, you don't understand.  I need a job.  I've got a kid and--
Yes.
I don't recall.
Do you have a lover now?
Yes.
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
No you didn't.  You didn't even ask about Billy.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
Goddamnit, Joanna. What the--
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours...  I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
She'll be back...
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Fine.
But I'm going to have to take some stitches.
Yeah, she said it wasn't any use talking anymore.
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
You're on your own, understand?
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
You and Charley?
Cow.
I do, beautiful horses. Thank you, Holiness.
Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
General Chiang.
It is calm.
Yes.
General Chiang Chin-wu, the Chinese representative, is en route to Dromo. He is coming to meet you.
Answer. 
No. This war is almost over.
Will we ever be in war?
When it is time.
Ask whatever you will.
Can India help us?
Britain?
Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
I will alert the Chinese delegation. You know, I would never have let you go alone, Kundun.
Good day.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
Always.
But you will always be here?
You will always!
Does he have the spot?
He does, a little spot where the butter had been.
True.
Soft. Nice. I have a good friend back in Lhasa.
I am braver.
Why is your beard so funny? Let me touch this.
But, I have no experience.
We have.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Eliminate you.
Completely.
Much too young.
Like my mother.
Jesus.  About twelve more yards.  Keep coming just like that.
I'll need any and all topographic studies.
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
That "Walt" guy got hit underwater--
Crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
Whenever somebody dies I consider it such a waste that I didn't know him better.
Then do it!!
Get the gun.
Look.  I know I'm crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  They have to, politically, he's too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
We both know what they'll do.
That's actually the easy part.
The more he thrashes, the better.
Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
I never had sex with you!
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
Are you sure?
Excuse me?
Yeah, you got bit.  I'm gonna fix it.
Ma'am, your first impression isn't going well.
I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  I never <u>believed</u> it.
Hector Cyr.  He's a rich kook mythology professor.  He's done some work with our museum.  He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
Adult males will charge hatchlings. If there's one out there...
Because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
Thank you.
Maybe.  I've always <u>read</u> about what's happened.  I've never... I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace <u>while</u> something is actually... y'know... happening.
You calm down!
We've got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
Likewise.
Other than to eat us?
I'll take it!
That's where they keep them.  You want me to bring the tooth out here?
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Well.  At wakes.
And this is how he came to the boat?
Sorry.  I'm just a little unclear as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here.
Ever even been <u>in</u> one?
You like Jack?
What is this?
<u>That</u> was a bust.
She's worried about the cow now.
I don't know.  Back the truck--
Are you on drugs?
Well on this one I'd like you to be.
<u>I</u> <u>am</u> <u>not</u> <u>going</u> <u>to</u> <u>Maine</u>.  That's ridiculous.
It was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
Shitbutt?
It would be rude. And he wouldn't get to ask any more questions...
He's here, Ardelia.
What girl?
Hot damn, Clarice.
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
NOOOOO! You fucking bitch don't you LEAVE ME down here, DON'T YOU - YOU
That wasn't me.
I think we may be, yes.
Good morning, Mr. Crawford.
A job's come up and I thought about you. Not really a job, more of - an interesting errand. Walk me to my car, Starling.
Not yet.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
Sir, what is it? There's something you're not telling me.
Good idea, but he thought of it, too. We've run simulations, using different vectors and the best dates we can assign. You put it all in the computer, and smoke comes out. No, this one is different. This one has seen us coming...
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
What should I say? You did fine work. We'll wait on the lab.
What would it take?
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Starling -
I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher.
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
I think so.
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
No, I came because we need -
Witless and misleading. Why do you think he takes their skins, Officer Starling? Thrill me with your wisdom.
No. You ate yours.
What's that, Dr. Lecter?
And have them clomping about in my life? Oh dear, no... At that time I still had certain private amusements of my own.  How did you feel when you saw him, Clarice? May I call you Clarice?
Jack Crawford is helping your career, isn't he? Apparently he likes you. And you like him, too.
Or doesn't this all begin to suggest to you a kind of... negotiation? There's something Crawford can give me, and I want to trade for it. I even wrote to him, offering my help. But he hates me, so he won't deal directly.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Yes.
A moth... How did you predict that?
I'm waiting for your offer, Clarice. Enchant me.
The death of my father.
Why, Clarice? Did the rancher fuck you?
Yes, Doctor. Please.
Later, listen, I'll -
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Do you think if you saved Catherine, you could make them stop...? Do you think, if Catherine lives, you won't wake up in the dark, ever again, to the screaming of the lambs? Do you...?
Dr. Lecter -
You want to see a violation? This is a violation...
You have my word. Paul?
Oh, and Senator...? Love you suit.
"Justice"?  If that's "justice"..., then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America, the better it will be for these people.
Yes I do! I know exactly what I am saying.  And if it is sedition, then I am guilty of sedition, too!
Isn't respect and friendship, a reasonable basis for a man and woman to be joined? And all else may grow in time...?
It can be dangerous...
I am sorry, Duncan...
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
No blood vengeance? No re-proach or insult?
Really? Do you want them to overrun all New York colony?
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
By your leave, sir.
Sir. Webb has no idea. And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements!
Sir!
Yes sir!
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
For Munro children?
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
Magua took the hatchet to color it with blood.  It is still bright. Only when it is red, then it will be buried.
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
That Le Renard has the power to lead his people into the light, I know well.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
Perhaps the General's glasses can reach to the Hudson and he knows the size and imminence of the army of Webb...?
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
We almost had an accident today. DeJesus' suit...
What mistakes?  Look, I think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check.
Why Sixpack?
No.  I think they isolated him in genetic engineering. Homo aquaticus...
Not exactly a big ocean country.
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
What's wrong with it?
Let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Not yet.
How's TransOcean doing?
I signed-up for the stock option.
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahili...standard pre-med background...
What music?  There ain't no music.
He didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
That <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
I do, man.  That's a beautiful place.  When I get out of here I'm going there.  Find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Jameson?  Who're you trying to con?
The air's stopped.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
Jameson?  Who are you trying to con...?
Answer them and quit kicking me!
I'm not touching you!
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
Don't worry, darlin, I'm...
Well, it's still a good idea.
At the bottom of a bottle and has been for two days; it's hit him hard.
That inspires confidence, that does.
I thought this was a pub.
You get the guns?
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
I am not fucking interested.
Good, you can get this under control now.
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
Fucking Northern monkeys.
No Harry, you can't.
You had better be careful.
Shit, Dog, there's a lot. Don't you want to do this next door?
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
Plank?
And the weed?
Hold on bollocks, no one but card players in here tonight sonny, and I do mean no one.
The man who decides if you can play is this man Harry, or Hatchet Harry as some including himself like to call him.
This is our money, Tom! . . . Now I think we should go.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
Do you want me to draw a picture?
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
So?
Well, excuse me, brother, mother or any other sucker, doesn't make any difference, they are still fucking guns, and they still fire fucking bullets!
Er, well, twelve.
How come you know so much about black cocks and so little about white pussy?]
So?
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
They stole our land--
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
No, sir. Not at all.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
You're dismissed, Private.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You're dismissed.
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Nice job.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it.
But they were Indians themselves.
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Didn't have a father?
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
He does.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
My government can go fuck itself, and so can yours. I'm talking about people here--men. Mi amigo Eladio Cruz is giving some friends of his a lift in his camion one day--
You going to get married?
What's it doing on a rifle range?
Have we had trouble there before?
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
Right.
I hear things, too.  People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
And people make their choice--
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio--
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that.
Aqui! [Here!]
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Seems like we have another one every week.
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Right.
Bledso
Open late.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve?
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
Your mother's family is Spanish?
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
And my father?
What?
You got in late last night.
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
I'll see what's going on.
Want to take a walk?
So she tells me three times a week.
Nice-looking kid.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
I mean what did we know about anything?
Yeah.
You'd do a good job.
You been talking so much trash today, you made us think you're a dangerous criminal. Be a good boy, now--
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
I haven't seen anybody come by.
But you don't see much competition, do you?
They don't hand those medals out for hidin'in your foxhole. Would you buy this?
One of Cleroe Payne's boys?
Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there.
You believe that?
You ever been married?
I told you --
Not yet.
Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm.
Harry.
Just curious.  Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix?  Dorothea?
Yes.  You do that.
Why don't you tell me the truth?
Swann said he could do stuff, yes.
He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he?
No it isn't.  You can't help me.
Nothing?
I'm sure.  He's dead.
Harry...
Sure.
No.  I'm not going near him.
So could you walk on water?
Go away.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
I don't think the dead much care.
Are you sure?
I'm afraid she's not in.
When will she be in?
You want more money, is that it?
Yes.
Was that Swann's idea?
Who is he?
At birth.  I don't know you --
What a tragedy.  It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
Or murdered, like Nix.
Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
No.
Who else did?  Did Valentin?
Looks that way.
Nobody's better off this wav!
You didn't try hard enough.
I can't... I can't go any further...
What?
No.
Yes! Yes!
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
Ok.
How long have you been married?
Oh.
I'm here for the week.
OK, see you downstairs.
I don't remember.
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
John thinks I'm so snotty.
How old is she?
Oh, she'll love it.
Around.
I'm going to miss you.
Well, I mean it more now.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
Fine.
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
When are you coming home?
Hospital?
What?
It's ok if you are.
It'll just be a few days.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
We're still going to be together.
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
Peter...Peter Kelson.
What do you mean?
I had to.
Please, the children.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
My parents are dead.  Don't even think of bringing them into this.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
That can't be right.  My birthday's tomorrow.
You have to say that.
What did he say to you in French?
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
You are the younger of two...
Get out of here.
Sometimes I can just feel the numbers.
You're referring to the defense's efforts to prove that George Viznick is tormented by "demonic voices?"
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Yeah, look at that sweet face.  You'd never guess he killed nine people.  I'm gonna get my smokes.  Be right back.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
You want the job or not?
Then I'll get you some punch.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
What?
Get used to it, babe.
Four days.
A horse?
Always on my ass, anyway.
No one's forcing her.
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
I know...
They ever love you back?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
I was just showing emotion.
I know.  But chances are...
Chances are there's still a chance.
So how's the job going?
She hates all freshmen.
What's up, Sidra.
Lucky.
I never knew a girl that could play.
I don't know.  A lot.
For how long?
Five seconds.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Shut up!
Please.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
What?
What'd it say?
I...can't.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
For real.  I should be alone, anyway.
I've been trying to find you all day.
It happens, right...
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
Few days ago.
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Thanks.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Something was just missing.
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
Then why are you so upset?
Well, can you give him this for me?
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
We still have to go?
Why not?
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
And some things should never fucking happen!
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Look, I'm busy.
You want me to fuck off?
I don't know.
HEY FUCK YOU DON WATCH IT NOW.
ooohhhhhh no.
What's wrong?
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
I'm really only equipped to take orders --
What kind of Cancer?
Sure is.  So why call me?
I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
It's the LAPD, can you open the door, please?
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
No one else in there with you?
No.
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
The gentleman who came to the door --
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
Eight o'clock?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  Should I get dressed up or -- ?
So you've done it --
No, no.
You wanna make a deal with me?
I'm sorry --
It's fine.
I'm sorry.
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
You mind if I come in, check things?
Yes.
Sure, why?
How much time do we have?
I don't know.
Bite it, Cynthia.  You could get free things from people that want you to endorse their products.
Son, please, now....
Are you a joker? huh? Tellin' jokes?
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
Hey. Watch the mouth. Watch it.
He's doing the interview with the lady --
I need you to interupt him, I need to get him on the phone with me right away --
No.  I mean, I'm telling you: I'm telling you that I have love.
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
You see?
Stay that way.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
You mind your own bussines.
Gently, son --
Braces?
Do you wanna sit down?
I need to sit down.
-- memory?
-- go, go, go.  I'm givin' pearls here. And I'II tell you samethin' else: I'm not succeding in the bush because I'm Frank TJ Mackey.  If anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, I run into some little muffin, knows who I am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "Yaddda-yadda-yadda, I saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  So me? I'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  Dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. But I'II tell you this: The battle of the bush is being fought and won by Team Mackey.  Can I have a cigarette?
Like I said, yeah --
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
-- let's talk more about your background --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
Yes.
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
the valley?
Well I guess it doesn't.
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
Ok.  That's why.  I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
About three weeks ago.
You're here.
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
No.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
I don't wanna have to lie to anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
Will you say my name?
I won't.
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
Yeah.
I'm not through asking my questions.
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
I think that she thinks I may have molested her.
...No....
I don't know.
You should know better.
Are you her boyfriend?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
What's MOW?
Not exactly, Linda. I'm not sure where you're going with this --
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around.  I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
Where will the money go?
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
Shut the fuck up.
....it's alright....
I'd like to get an order of...um...peanut butter.
mmm.hmm.
Yeah.
That's it.
Yes. What? Yes.
Thank you.
Shut up -- shut up --
You coulda been in front --
Alright.
hang in there, ok. I love you.
Go to bed.
..sorry...
....Why does he do it...?
May I speak with you?  Alone?
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Why would you ask now?  You never asked before!
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
I grow closer to my target, your Majesty.
Don't look so shocked, Phillippe. Come, you're going back to prison.
Tonight!  Right now!  We steal a man from a royal prison, we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide, and still you wish to tell me nothing?!
More wine!!
Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
But --
The secret I carry I cannot share. Not even with God.
Phillippe, get into the boat.  Into the boat!  Now!
There are more important things than tits.
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
Bread and wine... in that cupboard.
Best not to ask.  Shouldn't even talk about it.
I care only about Michelle.  Should I ask her when we first arrive? Or... or when we're leaving?  I could ask her in the carriage -- but it is more romantic at the palace. I get so confused...
Piglet -- ?  What are you -- ?
Die?  What...?
I have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge.
They must stay sharp.  There was an attempt on the King's life today.
She's a woman, d'Artagnan!  From a poor family.  You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but I am old and hard and I've seen too much.  Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
No man is all bad... or all good.  I believe -- I must believe -- that Louis can learn.  And perhaps I can help him.
Perhaps not as much as you might imagine.  When tutors answered every question except those about who I was.  When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been, I knew there was something different about me.  But a king...
Phillippe.  Rest now.
At least help Raoul.
It shall be done, your Majesty.
... The ball... Continue.
I must insist, Sire.
Out directing the search for the traitors.
When he returns, watch him.  When he leaves again, you tell me.
... Nothing.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
I don't think you understand. I don't mean shuffling papers in an office, I mean Jim Trudell worked classified assignments, special forces...sabotage...until last year. He was brought up on charges of espionage, but the charges were later dropped, and he sprang the service.
That's the point.  He slipped up, and he's desperate now.  And that means he's all the more dangerous.
Right behind you.
Gotta come from somewhere...
Hey what they did on their time was their business, you know?  I just want to catch this scumbag, wherever he is.
And who are you?
I'll live...
No Zydowski I didn't read today's paper - it's just going to irritate the hell out of me.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
Yeah?
No.
What happened with the tape?
I took it with me.  It's in a safe place.
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Jesus, man...
Please...
Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
How about Marvosa and the others?
I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
Tubbs, these people mean business.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
It was you who did the asking.
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
That's when it happened?
How are Molly and the boy?
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
Twenty minutes max.
You're his friend, Jack. Why can't you leave him alone?
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
What do you want to do?
Mrs. Leeds' fingernails and toenails. I think he took off his gloves, Jack.  And dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
Say we've arrested a good suspect. You walk in and see him. What is there about him that doesn't surprise you?
Why?
To recover the mind set.
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes.
It's not over yet.
It's a foregone conclusion. For Christ's sake, it's eleven PM.  The full moon is tonight.
He had to.
Have him peel the top label back.
I want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. To Meigs Field.  At Meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the Gulf Stream.
You're not going to need that. Because we're going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a St. Louis PD Swat team is going to take him. Not us.
Tonic will be fine.
Uh-huh.
Francis? Where are you?
No. Reba...?
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Do you feel privileged?
I don't know...
Are you a man?
Yes.
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
You will tell the truth?
Dr. Chilton.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
That's true.
What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecktor?
What would you call him?
What about the dog?
Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog?
I'm a forensic specialist, Molly. You've seen my diploma?  I got a diploma and everything.
I don't care.  He'll never see me or know my name. If we find him, the police will have to take him down. Not me, I'm just looking at evidence.
Huh?  Will? Is that you?
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Good for him.  Thanks a lot, Freddie!  Kevin. We're going grocery shopping.
Is Crawford going with you?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
I want to see you, too.
You went in the apartment?
Yes. Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. He was cutting her. I shot him.
No. I knew that I'm not smarter than you are.
What disadvantage?
Do you have the file with you
Pictures?
Yes.
You came here to look at me, Will. To get the old scent again, didn't you?
When you do have one I'd like to hear it.
I'll study it, Will. When you get more files, I'd like to see them, too. You can call me. When I have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. Would you like to give me your home number?
Fight what?
Why does it feel good?
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
I'm not a comedian.  I have no talent.  I'm a song-and-dance man.
I'm -- Fonzie? GEORGE NO!  The Fonzie!  The crazy breakout character!  The guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
Andy, they don't think you suck. They've just... lost a reason to love you.
You've got good days and bad days.
Yeah...
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
You know that's not what I meant! Look, I'm gonna put my foot down! No more playing alone.  You wanna perform, you GOTTA have an audience!
But that's it.  I needed you to believe!  Our family will be in the newspapers.  People will look, and they'll be touched.  Because your emotions were honest!
Oh.  So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
If you want...
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Have you told your family?
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
You're NOT DYING!
No!  Andy, don't do it --
It's so dirty.
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
It is apparently not working.
So HELP ME!  All I wanna do is MEDITATE!!
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
There!
What's your name?
I know.  It's her fault.
I intend to, believe me.  Someone has to.
Yeah, 'course I'm sure.
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
Yes.  You see, the truth is, Trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  But it's not here. It's in the Matrix.
The Matrix?  Yeah.
Really?
Goddamnit!
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
Please.  Come.  Sit.
More important than what is when?
Yes.  A singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. I must say I find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  I say almost funny.
Your mind makes it real.
I think I do.
Of the Resistance.
Don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  She is a guide, Neo. She can help you find the path.
Yes I do.
No.  I did not.  I have never told anyone this, Neo.  After I saw the Oracle I thought... no, I misunderstood what she told me.  I believed that it was all about me. That I would find the One, not that he would find me.
She told you exactly what you needed to hear.  That's all.  Sooner or later, Neo, you're going to realize just like I did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
We need an exit.
Who are you?
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
From what?
It's going into replication.
I'm coming with you.
Yeah?
The last human city.  The only place we got left.
Hell yes!
The Oracle.  She told me this would happen.  She told me...
Kick it in!  Kick it in!
Cypher, I thought --
You got sparklers?
'And with your spirit.'
'Dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
I know, I know, stupid.  I mean where you goin'?
Not quite...but keep trying.
What do you mean?
That'll help you out fine.  That's the best way for you, not for me! I swear to God, I'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  You understand?  I don't care what happens, he doesn't find out. 
No.
That bad, huh?
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that.
Get him in.
Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...?  Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
Nothin'.  Just stiffed those kids. Don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
$3,000.  Shit!  Can we hold it at $3,000?
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Nothing.
Nobody knows anything, believe me.
Not sick...just stupid.  Speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
I can take care of myself.  You know that.
Girls?  You call those skanks girls?!
Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
Well...no.
You ate?
Love that name.
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
And you could care less --
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
From the Korean War.
That's okay, Daddy.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
Oh, Mr. Parrish, I could never buy Parrish Communications.  I could pay for it, of course, but it would always have your imprint.
What 'business'?
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow.  There is a provisory by- law in our charter.  Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
He'll wait --
I didn't say.
Cold.
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
A voice?
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
Sure.
Yeah.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
That we did.  Thanks to you.  He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
He had no choice.  You're a formidable adversary.
Make it time.
Can do no right by people.  Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go.  Rahtid!
Didn't the family get together last night --?
Yes?
It's so very nice to see you again.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
No.
Peanut butter.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
I've got plenty of friends.
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time.  Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
Very well, I'll watch.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
Girlfriend?
No.
'To bed'?
I said get out.
I don't know who you are.
Yes, he's tired.  I believe so.
Yes!
It gets worse.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
It's a saying.
No --
Not at all.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
A 'deal'?
What do you mean?
Make an exception?
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Why didn't you stop me?
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
You were just curious?
Are you going to fire me, Bill?
I'll be the judge of that.
Not at all.
Well, they're mine now.
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew.  He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence.  Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
An offense --
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took.  Let me ask your opinion.  Do I blend in?
'Take me'...?  Where?
I still sense some doubt in this group, we could turn it around. You'll be up in the country?
The Board's working through the weekend, tying up the loose ends on this damn thing.  But I want to give it one more try, I'm still holding out some hope.
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time.  As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you --  -- or not.  Either way, thanks.
I hope so.
Thank God.  Now could we go?  Let's get this day started.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Joe?
Me?  Internal medicine.
I could be her.
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
Why?
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
I think I know her.
It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
Just loud enough to wake me up.
I'm sorry... um... ?
What's it like?
Seen you together, that's all.
He's not my friend, Burt. But if he calls, or if he turns up here, then you give me a call in my room, okay?
* I'm not too good on the phone. I need to		    * look people in the eye when I talk to			  * them.							    *
Who did this to you?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember you.
You Jimmy Grantz?							  *
So you have information for me?
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
I wasn't helping you for money.
So I just take your word?
Something feels wrong. I think someone's fucking with me. Trying to get me to kill the wrong guy.
What?
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
I told him about your car.
Why would you do that?
No!
What?
Can I ask you something?
What do you want?
So why did you come here?
I enjoy it.
Teddy!
Lemme take you down in the basement and show you what you've become.
You said you were leaving town.
No. No, just let me think for a minute.
He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
Easy for you to say, you've got the Jag.
Teddy. Your buddy.
Why are you following me?
I'm trying to help you. I knew she'd get her claws into you. She doesn't know anything about your investigation, so when she offers to help you, it'll be for her own reasons. Why would I lie? Do not go back to her. Take out a pen, write yourself a note, do not trust her.
The sort of questions you should be asking yourself.
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
Sammy didn't have a wife.
No. You took them out.						  *
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
Doing...?
I was the kids' godfather.
Recruit us to do what?
You can't.
Sure.
I got to talk to my ADO...
Right now.
Show me...?
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Zero risk.
Available cash is not an issue for us...
Why?
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Really?
Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can.
Of course.
Maybe.  Maybe with the crazy whites.
No.
You're not makin' a move on her...?
Chill out Sonny.
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
What's your Miami PD badge number?
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe.
I'm my <u>own</u> man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am?
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
White supremacist types.
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
They got a steady stream of supply. So, no...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
Not French registry?
I had to lay eyes on you.
Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from...
If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.
I show you what problem --
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Oh hell, forget it.
I ain't forcing you, like, I mean, who's forcing you?
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
They gotta be.
I simply don't have it, Joe.
Gonna be like money from home.
Get down -- where?
Twenty months?
Ziat!
Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar.
Stupid.
Aslan, there... 
Thank you.
I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter.
Jimmy?
We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace.  Now let's go.  Doubletime!
I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something.
And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful.
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into Greece?
Weird shit...?
Well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  Ain't gonna be much use, though.  Lines are dead.
What?
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
I pull.
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
You know what I mean...
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
We?
I heard how you talked to him.
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now?
I was just late.
That's camouflage...
How?!
Talk to me.
Peter...
We can do it!
Just like Trump Tower, then.
I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon.
I'm not much of a critic.
But you didn't even taste your cocoa.
How long...?
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
The Sistine Chapel?
No problem.
It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment.
She slipped away? She slipped away? She didn't just slip away. You did it. You did it. You did it. You did it. You murdered my Misery.
So you've indicated. Do it.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? "You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie." Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man.
I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know.  Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered--  --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, "This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--"
Nothing.
You better. Oh, Paul, when Ian realized that the reason they'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma--
Have to wait.
It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles?
What?
No, I haven't.
Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot.
Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice.
How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here.  Where the hell is that thing?
There's that spice again.
Yes, he is.
If I can.
Newspapers?
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
I am. Well, maybe not completely--
How grateful?
Mmmm.
And my room?
Ulrich will be about.  He'll look after you.
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
Oh well, if that's how you feel about it.
Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
Well, Senor de l'Arena, there's no reason to disrupt your party any longer.  we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards, which you'll receive in our written report by fax in the morning, hard copy to follow.  Shall we?
Wanted to see how good you were. I'm hoping we might work together.
So do I.  Sort of.
Five, six-hundred thousand.
Sean Ambrose, for one.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
I'll muddle through.
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
It's going to be okay.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
And then what?
We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority, but that won't stop Ambrose, and beyond him, we don't know who else we're looking for -- all terrorist bank accounts of which we're aware are stable.  No deposits, no withdrawals.  Therefore no suspects.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
Well, yes.  I suppose I am a bit anxious.
Yep.
Ninety-seven minutes, twenty-seven seconds.
Good job.  And thanks.
You are infected with <i>Chimera,</i> my friend.
You took it!  All of it!  And what if I need it?
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
S.O.P..
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
Why the masquerade?  Why take the risk? Well, Claire, youíve asked the question and you are the answer.
Always.
Don't move.
That was four hours ago!  Who sent you? Did they send you here?
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
What kind of help?
You don't think we're going to make it.
I just need you to be safe.
Yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
Ethan?
Itís all right, Ethan..youíll bring me back...wonít you...
Do you read me?  <u>The list is in the open</u>!
Location green.  One hour.  Iíll be there myself.
Heard a lot about you, Hunt.  Donít disappoint me.
One hour.
You mean <u>I've</u> lost enough agents for one night.
Who else is left?
Yes.  I see your point.
Why was there another team?
This whole operation was a molehunt.
How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
Information.
You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?
Oh man...I don't know.  I'm gonna miss being disreputable.
That depends.
I'm NOC.  Was.  <u>Now</u> disavowed.
Even so, I'm sure you could arrange an introduction.
Six million dollars.  I'll give you the same.  But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe.  I won't do this piecemeal, it's too dangerous.  I want the <u>entire</u> list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
How will you make sure Job will be there?
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
I wouldnít worry about him.  Once youíve got the money -- heíll find you.
Roger that.  Opening doors now.
Jim we canít.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
Oh?  What's the problem?
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
No.  Abort.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
I remember..
I don't know.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
Twenty minutes.
Connection denied.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
You're welcome.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
Yeah.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
In a month.
I didn't give you away the first time.
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
What'd you do to your hair?
And what did they say?
I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
Excuse me.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
A bride without a head!
Where are you taking me?
I've got you.
What about Johnny?
Oh no I didn't!
I'll come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Alright. Where's the Met?
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead.  Come on, let's go in.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
Yeah.
How can you ask me that?
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
This is where we're going!
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
I'm really afraid.
No.
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
Will you marry me?
I don't understand.
Yes, on the floor.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Alright. A month. In a month.
You have a brother?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
Why not?
I got married before, you didn't sell.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
No. He don't.
Did he tell her?
It was a miracle.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
I don't know.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
Where is she?
My mother's recovered.
Okay, I'll tell her.
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
She was just too young for you.
What do you do?
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
What you don't know about women is a lot.
Oh.
Is who down there?
Cosmo.
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
You're using coconuts!
What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
All of us are ... we are all Britons.
Oh!
And not too expensive.
What?
I have no quarrel with you, brave Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
Who ... Who breaks out?
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
It's always the same ... if I've said it once.
You didn't bother to find out, did you?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
Yes, I see.
... must be approved at a bi-weekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs.
Shut up, will you. Shut up!
Oh, Did you hear that!  What a give-away.
And don't apologize.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's sorry this and forgive me that and I'm not worthy and ... What are you doing now?
Ah ... but can you not also make bridges out of stone?
What is your quest?
What is your favorite colour?
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
Camelot?  Are you from Camelot?
What - the curtains?
I'd rather ... just ... sing ...
Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father - that's all -
... and you'll come and get him.
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Is that clear?
Mine is Zoot. Just Zoot  But come.
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
It's too perilous.
... I Bet you're gay.
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
Brave, Sir Rob ...
Shut up.  Oh, nobody really. just passing through.
When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
I speak as I find, Archie.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
The woman's surrounded by fools!  She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
Yeah.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...?
My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy.
I beg your pardon?  Mama...?
Convey her a message.
It is quite late enough.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
Yes.  I do.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
I beg your pardon?
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her.  What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
There are important papers from --
Occasionally.
I don't think about it.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
Aye.
Her mind is set.  She won't change now.
See what?
Too busy looking after themselves.
No loyalty.
She'll think I betrayed her.
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
Ma'am.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
That doesn't make him an expert.
Ah, well...
To keep out the cold.
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
Have I ever let you down before--?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
Then why send me back to them?!
I came as quickly as I could.
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead.
So?
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Yes.
He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
Why?
Unwell?
Of course, at once.
Again?
Why not?
If I tell you, then it's no fun.
Yeah...
Quiet.  I do have parents, you know.
No I'm not...
Dante's Inferno.
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
No.  If you're smart, you run like hell.
One.  In case...
Don't even say it.
You've got the schematics, check.
Hold my keys, then.
You have no time.  What is your question?
In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild...
Sign me up.
Give her a chance, will you?
I'm going home Cynthia.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
Interest?! There's six of the top actresses that want this thing.
So, this is the last time I see you then unless I do bad?
The fact is Mr. Kesher a representative of your bank called us.
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
Sweetie, look at me straight.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
I want to play this one close, Bob. Like it was with that girl, what's her name, with the black hair. That felt good. Whaddya think?
Before what?
Can you tell me what happened?
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
"So... surprise"...
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
Keep going. Go around to the back.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Yes, Sir.
Betty Elms.
Yeah, what for?
Okay. Why this Denny's?
I had a dream about this place.
Right then.
Could be...any of those dead kids wearin' pearl earrings?
Nope, not yet. Their fingerprints don't match up anywhere.
You'll keep your eyes open for me won't you baby?
Pick with expediency !
I have an embezzler and his accomplice.
No time. Get him up.
I made this place..... now listen to me. I'll get out of this room, we have bigger troubles than this....
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
I'm not fucking him..
We have to climb up that.
If you hadn't started boffing that weasel with an attitude, you wouldn't be here.
Is this really the time ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
He hired you to build this place ?
I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
What do you mean ?
McCay had a lot money done into researching psychological reactions to questions that are seemingly unrelated, but reveal everything. Like criminal impulses, homicidal impulses.....
Bye....
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Look...
Where ?
When I think you're ready.
Trust is earned not given away.
And who bailed you out when a hit was put on you, you sorry sack of shit. Who put you up ? Who gave you a job ?
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
So ?
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
If you want, I can fire you and have someone else who has the balls terminate these worthless people. Which will it be ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
I thought that was Darwin, sir. Or perhaps Nietzsche ?
I have to say, that I am glad you are such an amazing kiss ass.
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I'll bet that would be the Park run of the century !
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
Then what do you want ?
Have you ever considered running your own "Park" ? I mean, since you will not be returning to your former profession.
I don't know.....
I can see that but where ?
Which one, this door is locked !
"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
Zach from work ?
I'm fine.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
Are you writing a poem?
Oh I doubt it...lectures are notoriously boring.
Yeah, well I don't think you're very grateful. A lot of people in your position would say &quot;thank you&quot;.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
You want me to move?
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
Seriously.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Of course.
Thanks, I needed that.
Hi Dad.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Give my love to Shelly.
What're you saying?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
Special effects?
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
That's okay.
He likes you.
Well if it isn't Vada, the grasshopper girl.
Give it back Nicholas!
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken.  Just ask him.
Give it to me!
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Big deal.
This is a totally barbaric custom.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Was Rose.
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
But...are you engaged or something?
Yes, it does.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
He was caressing.
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Something wrong?
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
You told everybody where you were going, I'm here for the motor home.
Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that's what the lawyer said, it's supposed to be &quot;OUR MUTUAL ASSET&quot;, not &quot;Shelly's recreational vehicle&quot;. Gimme the keys.
Yeah, all right...
What Hurts Vada?
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Harry, I really think she.....
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
No kidding?
It's no big deal.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Okay, sure.
It's nice.
What happened to her?
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Is there enough room?
Want to what?
Goodnight.
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Can I go too?
Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
He was allergic to bees.
Did you not tell Vada I'm a womanizer huh?
Hi, is Vada home?
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
Well, you never can tell...  I might get a pet. 
Thirty five dollars.
For this class?
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
He won't give it to me.
Thomas?
Can I use your bathroom first?
Sure.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Hi.
Yes!!
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I think it should be outlawed.
They're just fun to read.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
It'll bleed.
If I do it, can we go?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
I stopped that!
What do you want it for anyway?
I am running faster!!
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Sure.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
No, I'm hiding out.
Like they do on TV?
No.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Close your eyes.
Okay, okay.
Okay on the count of three.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
You've been working on this, huh?
That was Thursday.
Major.  Dish.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
Hello.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
... see, that's what I thought at first.  How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
What's next?
Till the gas ran out.
Have you.
Except for that.
It's over.
A bad combination.
No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
She admits it's her fault.
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
Lower.
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
That's little egotistical.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
To him.
Well, if that's the way you f...
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
... I'm partial to the tight end.
Well, that just happened that time.
Come on.
No.
Well, I just wondered 'cause being from out or town I wouldn't be able to make anything.
Oh just about everything, I guess. Those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. They keep taking things out. She's going to come home an egg shell. Tough, though.. She's tough.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
Well, you did and she's fine. Thanks.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
That's pretty close. He's going to be on the bill. Why not put Barbara Jean on with him?
I said 'no!'
Your job, huh.
Yes. She's pretty rested up.
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Where the hell have you been?
I think we can do that. Come in.
Well I've been following him around Just listening to him --He says he can really win -- I bet he can too - -
I mean, Mr. Green was so nice to me. He took me in and...
She had on high heels?
Do you carry door handles?
What kind?
Nashville.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
About three years.
And before?
Linnea?
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
What?
I know.
Car pool?
I'm not sure.
Come on, you ever been attracted to a black guy?
What?
Hello.
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Probably a little too long.
Come on.
Just a minute.
Hello.
Why?
You go to school together?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
You think I should take lessons?
You serious?
I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious.
The key lime is great, but it's an acquired taste.
Try to keep it to a minimum.
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
They've been separated since their incarceration in a couple of penitentiaries---
I can appreciate that.
How's it goin'?
Slide the shotgun over here, put your hands behind your head, put your forehead on the floor.
She was born without a tongue.
Not good.
It's video.
Yours.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Don't worry about it.
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
That's indescribable.
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
Where's it parked?
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
I do, too.
Survival of the fittest.
They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune.'
Capt'n!
It's hard to say Capt'n.
I'll say enough to destroy this wing.
This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla.
Fine. Roger, what the hell are you doing? You're bothering the serial killer.
Coolin' her jets in a holding cell.
Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.
Slate it.
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
By all means.
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
Ya know, I was.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
It sure is.
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
Fine.  Julie, why don't you make a food run?  What's around here?
No thanks.
I hear you're tryin' to organize this place!
Well, what d'you know?!
No. You got the wrong idea.
Anderson.
Like where?
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
How 'you doing?
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Cup of coffee.  I 'been meanin' to talk to you.
Okay, I will.
I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
You working?
Yeah. On the section gang.
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
How about another beer?
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
That's why you come back, huh?
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Yeah. Well, I do.
Are you married?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
I'll see you later.
I'll have some coffee, please.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
My kids want me to teach them.
Yeah!
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
What d'you mean?
Let's go, Jocko. The man's got homework.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
'Bye, Jocko.
No.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
That's right.
No, thanks.
How often is that?
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
No thanks, Lee.
Good-bye, Duff.
I guess I ain't.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Hell, they're all after the same thing.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
Sometimes, I want to blow his fucking brains out!
Omar, listen to me--
Enough talking!  We been talking for eleven fucking hours, man.  My throat's fucking raw!
I'm still on my honeymoon.
What about her?
Of course...
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
You're a substance abuser, Case. Your pancreas was shot. Wouldn't have lasted out the year. We did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
And then?
I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
The antitoxin. I'm not waiting until this is over. Give it to me now or there's no run.
Patience, Mr. Case. Only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
It's so easy for you, isn't it? You let Linda Lee die in Chiba City. Now you leave me with Molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. Perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, Mr. Case.
Last I heard you cracked Sukura International. I couldn't believe it.
Founders of Zion. Builders of Freeside.
The girl 3Jane. We need her.
Can you walk?
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
We're dead men if we go back there, Maelcom. They'll hunt us down.
I can't feel nothing because I am nothing.  Just playback. A ghost in the machine.
Not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
The angels... I think they're calling your name.
I hear that shit once a week. Don't worry. Jo Jo Bao loves me.
I had to limit your options.
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
Couple of months.
Hey... you're not supposed to be up.
I'm not jacking with Armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
They'll cut you down.
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
Then you and Maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
Sure. No problem.
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
It is?
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Nope.
You're Pam?
Right. Right.
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
Anita!
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
What if I say no?
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Are you in special ed?
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Do you remember high school?
It was a long time ago -
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
I love the way she writes.
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  Are you sure you're seventeen?
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Yeah, actually I do.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I don't know.
Well, a ball player.
And heavy...
But I guess my best just isn't good enough.
There's nothing more suspicious than Worm's Wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
Maybe he doesn't know...
No.  Upstairs.
Jesse's dead!  I sliced 'im real good!
Get outa here.
It was okay.
Listen to me, Grady, this is serious. Something really weird is happening.  It started out like just bad dreams but it's getting real bad.
How come?
Ah, nothing.
Yeah?
That's typical.  I hope she didn't expect to make the best seller list with this thing.
I don't know - into the air I suppose.
I'll get over it.
he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
Kristen specializes in strangeness.  I've spent thousands on psychiatirists.
I'm sorry to hear that, but you're the experts on this, not me.  If I had any insights, believe me, I'd share them with you.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Research.
But...it's just a house I've dreamed about.  I dream about it all the time.  Thank you for what you did last night.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
How do we find him, Kristen?
They sedated me.  We're stuck here till it wears off.
I'm so proud of you all.  Tell Neil I...
Pulled night duty.  Trimble's sick.
I don't do that shit.
Restless.  Very restless.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
Oh God.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
Call it a passion.  I've got to get going.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
With Hypnocyl?
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
Do you think we can get the Hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
C'mon.  Let's get out of this rain.
Remember -- open mind.
I'll be okay.  Just give me a minute.
Listen.
Nothing.  They're my patients.  It's my decision.  I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Oh, stop showing off.
Orange juice -- probably not.
Right.  Great.  Classic.  Classic.
And what happens next in the dream?
Okay.
I thought you were leaving.
Nothing.
Exactly.  Here we go again.
Step aside.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Hand it over.  Basic plot?
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes.  Always have had.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
Stay forever.
How do you think I'm doing?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
That's spectacularly unfair.
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
I haven't decided.
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
And this is William.
I never fancied you much actually...
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Da Vinci?
Hun -- this is Anna.  Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check.
Yes, better get me a half.  All I can afford.
Yes.  No, wait -- let's go crazy -- I'll have an orange juice.
Buggered?
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I believe I have.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Oh right.  I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
So -- any messages?
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
No, 'fraid not.
And you get on very well.
Yes.
Oh sure.  Of course.
What book?
I haven't got a book down my trousers.
And yet you suspect her.
I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
I-I-I-I c-c-c-came over S-S-S Sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and I s-s-said, I said, 'C-C-C-Celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
I was in luh-love with her.
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Sh-sh-sh-she m-m-made m-m-me do it!
You sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, don't ya!
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
What the hell does that have to do with it? This is an important event and I want a vote on it!
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
So do I!
You mean to tell me you're gonna count those old birds over there?
Ma'am, I'm as gentle as a puppy dog. Why, I haven't licked the tar out of an aide for two weeks! Hi ya, Doc!
Well, put 'er there, Billy boy, my name's McMurphy.
Y-Y-You m-mean th-the pr-president of the P-P-Patients C-Council?
Wh-wh-where ya going, M-M-Mac?
Wu-wu-wu I-I-I-I th-th-think sh-sh sh-she's th-th-th-the ma-ma-ma-most bu-bu-bu-beautiful wu-wu-wu-woman in th-th-the whole world!
P-p-p-please duh-duh-duh-duh t-t tell, M-M-M-Miss R-R-Ratched, y-y you don't need to!
Ya like that, Chief, huh?
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
Yeah!
Hey, what's that?
Your buddy is callin' ya.
That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck?
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I'm not running a charity ward...
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Sorry, buddy, I'm clean outta change...
Hold it a minute.
He's not!
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
Oh, what was that?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Good. Good.
Good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
No, 'fraid not...
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
All right!
Ten bucks.
That right?
Miss Itsu.  In here, please.
How's your ass been holdin' up, honey?
Big man!
I'm sure you will.
Is everything all right?
Oh, that. That ain't nothin' to be afraid of, ma'am. Just ol Chief Bromden. That's all...
Is he in an asylum?
He's dead.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
She's been acting weird lately, though.  I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication".  Like I don't know how to communicate.
Oh no.  Do you?
No...
Sa dov'e' lui?
But Faith--
Non.  Please.
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
My name's 
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
He's safe.
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Yeah.
We were hungry.
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
Well.  Congratulations.
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
Yes?
How about the other one?  His friend.
No.
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
He's a podiatrist or something.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person. 
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
Are you sure?
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
Only what?
Only, it's in Italian...
You think he misses me at all?
Right.  My brother.
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
What?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
...and a fortune teller.
My God... you're right.
Yup.
I didn't expect you back so soon.
What about Larry?
I'd love to.
I thank you.
Giovanni.
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
What?  You know him?
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
Talk louder. I can't hear you.
Sure we keep records!
We was robbed last night and we can't find no books.
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers  a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor.  But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Mmhmmm.
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against 
I know. I know.
Don't say that!
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark!  and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
I'll get home all right now.
Man, you were a mess!
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
I don't know.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.
One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
In a saloon?
How do you like it?
It's quite  nice.
No thanks... .
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts!  You really believe that drool?
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
Go ahead, wear it.
I know... I know... .
I've been sittin' in the church.
You?
The Father. The Father.
I just told the Father.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Edie, for years we pushed quarters into a cookie jar, to keep you up there with the Sisters, and to keep you from things like I just seen out the window. My own daughter arm-in-arm with Terry Malloy. You know who Terry Malloy is?
Who is he! Edie, you're so softhearted and soft-headed you wouldn't recognize the devil if he had you by the throat. You know who this Terry Malloy is? The kid brother of Charlie the Gent, Johnny Friendly's right hand, a butcher in a camel hair coat.
He wanted to see me again.
See this arm? It's two inches longer 'n the other one. That's years of workin' and sweatin', liftin' and swingin' a hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to myselfthis is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin' decent. I promised your mother. You better not let her down.
What do you want from me, Father.
Mind your own business, Father.
Give me that gun.
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
So help me God!
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
Yeah, really!
Sure... .
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
He's got his nerve, gum-shoeing around here after what you told him.
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
Now just a minute, I
You want to know somethin'?
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
One little dime you don't need.  I know you you're Edie Doyle. Your Brother's a saint  only one ever tried to get me my compensation.
I wonder how many Hail Marys the Father'll make me say at confession.  It'll be worth it! The pallet is loaded now. Terry turns and approaches Nolan.
You don't think he'd be helpful?
I do not joke in my proposal.
I'm not sure I care to find out what it is.
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
Can't we get out of here?
What can we do?
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
I'm afraid I'll faint.
I am--It's our only chance.
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
Yes I feel it in my bones.
You love me then?
A situation easily remedied.
I know the laws of the night. I state there is still time for yet another.
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
There are others.
Yes, Master, and we caught them, him and me.
Aannnnaahhnn.
Aannnnaahhnn.
And the one driving the other car?
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
Why not?
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades.  He does, he's gonna try to find me.  Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Shit.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Snoopy.  Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
Two hours.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look.  Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Yeah, I did.
At least.
All you gotta do is get in.
I'll go with you.
What'd you talk about?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
I have to qualify, is that it?
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
But don't you <u>do</u> anything.  You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
Good.  Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
The manager's door is metal.
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
How are you, Raymond?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
That's right.
Let's go outside and talk.
One I gave him, yeah.  Fuck...
It was just a year, give or take a few days.  I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything.  We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know?  That spark, you know what I mean?  You gotta have that.
Sure.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
Nothing.
And your gun.
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
It smelled.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens.  It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition.  Like you both know something.  But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?"  It might happen only a few times in your life.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
He killed a police officer.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
I'm just going to the bathroom.
You think I'd shoot you?
You just did, for Christ sake.
Who you talkin' to, Studs?  Me, or Buddy.  I can't tell, you got those shades on.
Use your head.  The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
I don't know...
Looks like tonight.
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
Maurice?  From Lompoc?  Good God.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
The flight?
That time?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
I remember you now.  Shit.
Why's that?
I'm freezing my ass off.
Uh-huh.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
No thanks.
I really gotta go.
No?
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
Out for the evening?
He's in Florida.  Palm Beach.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
Red...Strange?
Only when I'm n-n-n-
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Power dive!
Home of the brave!
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
How's this for a fact?  I loved her first.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Little less.
Yes you can.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to.  Rafe was...he was lonely.  He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty.  The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
Then wh-where do we land?
Y-Yes Sir.
Yes'm.
It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
I have arranged a live fire drill -- with your permission.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
The time has come to strike!  Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future.  I know what you whisper to the others, Yamamoto -- that the Americans are strong.  Yet look at their leader.
The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans.  No matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. If we must go to war, there is only one way -- deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover.  In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
He does?
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
I'm not going.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
Right. I promised my mother.
Charlie, how are you?
He's trying.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
I know.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I'll just set it right here.
Oh, God, Dion.
Then hold me.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Test?
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
What?
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
I'm excused.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
Sort of.
I had a dream that Grandma died.
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
Don't be silly, I'm the best in the county.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
What was?
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it fourthirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
There's one way to find out.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Wbat're you talking about?
High tech. I like the sound of that.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o~ that before?
Silicon is from sand.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
One... two... three.  You are now awake.
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
Not true.  I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
Did you break up with Charlie?
I... um...
My God...  ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife...
I don't know what you expected to find, Matthews. There's nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander...
I'll be fine, Dad.
I'm not trying to prove anything.  I was burying my dog.
He pissed me off.
Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight...  I mean... he misses you, Mom...
You know everything, don't you?
I came back for you, Geoff. We're going to be together again.
You'll have to get right on it, Andy, we're up against the statute of limitations.
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Some people think you have an attitude problem, Beckett.
Maybe you should think about it.
I'm not ready to die.
More than your friend. Family.
A carrot?!
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
Sounds delightful.
One week old.
How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me?
We?
Correct. I don't.
Find a lawyer?
Thank you for sharing that with me, Joe.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I know a good probate lawyer.
You're ready, don't worry.
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
You bet. We'll see you later.
Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall.
I guess it was 1984, 85.
You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
Yes.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
You're in trouble.
Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you!
You're the asshole, buddy.
Who?
Probably since she was born.
Night, honey.
Any women on board?
So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise, is that correct?
I've seen your television commercials. "If you or anyone you know has been injured through the fault of others... It should say, "through the <u>negligence</u> of others."
You had one guy "like that?"
We ought to be suing him.
Andy, you don't want this.
What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to?  What is it, Bob?!
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  Hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
What whispers?
Slam doctor. Well, we called him "doctor."
Well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? Then again...I am worth twice as much alive.  Didn't know? Johns ain't a cop. Oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and I'm just a payday. That's why he won't kill me. The creed is greed.
Had it with deals.
Nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. I fuckin' knew better.
We can, can't we? Trust you?
Let's drop back an' boot up.
Riddick? How close?
Truthfully? I wouldn't know how.
Got a better idea. Come with <u>me</u>.
Here. Make it easy on you.
No one's gonna blame you. C'mon. Take my hand and save yourself, Carolyn.
Not sure. Ten?
I don't need his life story. Is he really that dangerous?
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.
Let's just be sure.
So what happened? Where are they, then?
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
How much?
He's dead. Cap'n's dead. Christ, I was looking right at him when --
Company's not here, is it?
And there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>That's</u> how they train you! On a fucking simulator!
"Some prophet guy." And a city man. But he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of God.
No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
Blessing you like the others.  It's painless.
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
Didn't say that. But least this way I don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
Oh, so I'm disposable?
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
Just realized that, huh?
So much for my cocktail hour.
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
No sir, I haven't forgotten.
That's correct. And you will both stand trial for heresy.
No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I can pay you back.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Well, maybe they're not.
There was one bad moment -- some hunters stopped us.
That way.
Any particular reason?
You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment.
No change. The minute you open the door, he goes into his act.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
I'm prepared to die.
All right...  Get in...hurry.  Put this on.
And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what's to be done with him.
My name is Taylor.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Sustain all objections, but face the truth!
Then you admit --
Thank you for calling me Taylor.  Dr. Zaius, I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever get started?
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
When were the Sacred Scrolls written?
He might have been wiped out by a plague. Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of this part of your planet, I'd say that was a fair bet.
Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
Shhhh!
It's humiliating.
Do you believe him?
Like you, I find it difficult.
Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes.
What?
Fuckers returned fire soon as we lit 'em up. Hard core fuckin' NVA. They got their shit together.
YOU - you're going to fuckin' jail, buddy, you ain't getting away with this one!!!!!
Barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  Third Platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. Flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when Third Platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. We'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. It'll be a massacre!
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool. Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself...
You mean he's crazy? No more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
What are the heads?
Later...
Broke a 100. Got 92 to go. April 17. DEROS man. California this summer. Waves are good they tell me, surfin's gonna be good...
So he got a reduced and come over here. Nam's his freedom man, Nam's his pussy. Three years he been here.
He dugged his own grave.
That's what he is... Baaaa!
I don't want to hear your problems, Jackson. You'll get new men any day. Time being you make do like everybody else.
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
Immigration Officer?
Sit down then. We often have a double up here.
As I said before...
I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
Whatever you say.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
He was a great boy for that. What else?
No thanks.
Bad enough.
At this time of night. It's not as bad as it looks.
They know you here--know your name.
We walked right passed him. He's following us.
No percentage in that.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
I was tried for murdering my husband.  Guilty.  The judge set the verdict aside.  There was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  They were all afraid--of my father-in-law. That man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  My father-in-law will never give up. Never.  He promised me that.  So I came to Vancouver, B.C. As far away as I can get from North Carolina.  And it happens all over again.  Almost the same thing. Almost the same way.  Do you wonder about this--
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
It did, but it never paid off-- until now.  I ought to be back within an hour. We can't leave until near dark anyway.
You wouldn't like it.  I've been there.
Wonder what?
Including Killaine.
Magruder obliged me.  No use my saying it wasn't planned that way. I had to clean up.  I'm not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  Nobody in the world would believe I didn't plan the whole thing.
Shut up!  Cut it out!  Even if I have to kill both of us--
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Beer or ale, Miss?
I don't know her.. or particularly want to.
Why don't you arrest me and be done with it.
They're all crude, when they don't work. Had breakfast?
Deep blue? I'd call it grey-blue.
I've never been to Florida.
Is it a crime?
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
I always wear gloves when I shoot people.  A bad joke--but better than tears.
But even if you were in love with me.
Information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  That's the funny part of my business-- once in a while, I get hired not to work.  Nice girl you were with last night. Known her long?
$40 a day and expenses. Expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I'm a long way from home. I don't have a B.C. Licence. I'd need about $500 for a retainer.
For five hundred, what do I get?
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
They still hang women in Canada, I've heard.
That comedian?
How's life treating you?
That's what I thought, at first.  Maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  With my liquor of course.
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
I don't.
That must hurt.
It could have been an accident.
You don't buy it.  Okay.  So I still want Betty Mayfield.  Where is she?
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Mr. Mitchell.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
That's not enough.
He was very easy to hate. If you'll look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you'll know why.
No, Not recently. I'm sure of that.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
Would you?
Men like you don't need orders.
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Market... It seems to me that's a San Francisco exchange.
I think so.
You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
Well.  What about it?
A think wire---but very, very strong.  Let's get out of here.
I never wear a hat.  Oh, so I am. I forgot.  I guess I'm terribly sorry again, Mrs. West.
It was Clarendon.  He knew I had the gun in my bag.
I am a fool.
That depends upon your motive. You were in love with Mitchell, weren't you?
Mortar shells are not funny, either.
And if you didn't believe me?
That leaves two strangers.
When I give an order, you'll not need it interpreted.  You have an hour to make your mind up.  Well, are ye satisfied, Mr. Mitchell?
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Nobody's covering her, I detached the officer assigned to that duty.
I disagree, sir.  As Inspector in charge of the case I have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
Identification on possible, Sir. Not conclusive.
I do.
Why should I mind?
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
You already have the checks, darling.
I didn't mean it that way  I'm sorry.
Right.
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden.  And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
He was delightful.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, many things.  Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve.  We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge.  A new broom with very old bristles.  When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
I'll suggest it.  Remember though, we're news, not features.  It might help if you could get yourselves attacked by the police.  Anyway, I'll be back with this soon. Thanks.
Keep me company.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
I'll have some of that.
...break away completely from--
Yes, please.
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
And to history.
No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
Did she talk about me?
I might.
Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
We were just chortling over that. Blasé and epicene.  It perfectly describes the new Foreign Secretary. So--I hope you don't mind, Edward, I pinched it for my piece today.
Name so Susie Barrington.  Daughter of the eminent historian, Anne Barrington, step-daughter of the scandalous Matthew Byrd the acclaimed sack-artist...
It's shit.
Let me see.
Get way.  You'll see when I'm ready. First I want you to reflect on my noble behaviour, on how your interests are closest to my heart, how I lay awake at night worrying--
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
I'm off.  Let's meet.  You promised to tell me about Norfolk.
Yes, finally.
She said awfully sorry, make yourself comfortable, she won't be long. .
Oh, I see.
Do you want to hear my list of English Kings and Queens?
It goes from Henry VIII.  Henry VIII, Edward IV, Mary, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles I, Charles II, James II, William and Mary, Ann, George I, II, III and IV, Victoria, Edward VII, George V, Edward VIII, George IV, Elizabeth II.
Terrific.
Dad.
No, thanks Dad.
No, he wasn't.  He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said...  'Oo I do feel bad.  I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'
Tom . .. bed!  Go on.
Actually, I've been once today already.  I'll stay here with him.
Pure adrenalin, right?!  The ultimate rush.  Other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
Look, Bodhi man.  People are dead. The ride is over.
Jesus Christ, Bodhi!
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
Caught my first tube this morning.
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
What that?
Reagan usually drives.  Stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  When they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  And I mean vanish.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Sure.  No problem.  I'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  Shit, he'll probably call out the National Guard.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Sure.
What are you talking about?
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
I'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named Utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and I let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when I could have easily helped him.
Wait!  Jesus Christ!  You're fucking crazy, you know that? You go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  Here, follow me.
Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya.
Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. They're about to get squeezed. We can't let that happen. I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department... and here we are.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
We're not going.
Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch. Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right. Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along.
I can't tell.
Please, we hardly know each other.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
What?
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
You're making the right decision, sir.
Yes.
That's ridiculous.
What motel you staying at?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
I never joke about money.
Edward.  My name is Edward.
Exactly.
Diet coke.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Do you plan everything?
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Occupational hazard?
Mmm, I could tell.
I sell them.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Not... quite.
Don't drown.
Five full nights... days too?
Holy shit.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
I got a dress, yeah.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
I have work to do.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
No.
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Vivian...
What if someone tries to steal it?
Where are you taking me!?
I've never treated you like a whore.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
My what?
No one you know.
But, Edward...
Doing what?
Bill?  Stop panicking.  Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I'll be in the office tomorrow.
We'll be there.  Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office.  I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
Let him answer.
All this because of that whore!
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
Kit!  Where've you been?
Why'd he want you?
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
Go for the bucks.
Do I!?  Momma!
Rent.  You're late.
You bullshittin' me?
Oooh, I love those.
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
Then you would use your--
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel.  Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
Miss Vivian.
It's okay.  Edward told me.  Your secret's safe with me.
Then why bother curing me?
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
With pride. What can I do for you?
You mock my pain!
Now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
I could kill you now.
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin.  Go!
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
It's you.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
What?
Well, I wasn't nervous.
What is it? What's the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
I'm telling you you're messing up the story, now get it right!
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
Stop saying that!
Hah?
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
You're that smart?
Then make your choice.
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
I'm not listening.
A life expiring and you don't have the decency to say why you won't help --
What?
Yes.  Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn- turn-kick-turn!  It's enough to make you throw up!  At last a chance to do straight drama!  To deal with conflict, with inner truth.  Roger De Bris presents history.  Of course, I think we should add a little music.  That whole third act has got to go. They're losing the war.  It's too depressing.  We'll have to put something in there.  Aaahghhh!  I see it!  A line of beautiful girls, dressed as Storm Troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... Two-three-kick-turn!  Turn-turn- kick-turn!
Get on the phone.  Send out a casting call.  Call every agent in town.  I want to see everybody. Everybody.
"Of the silvery moon,
"I want to croon,
"To my honey I'll croon,
"Honeymoon, honeymoon,
You mean ooops, don't you?  Say ooops and get out.
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
I'm Leo Bloom, I'm an accountant, I'm from Whitehall and Marks, I was sent here to do your books and I'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady. 
Do the books!  Do the books!
You have forty-eight seconds left. Hurry.  Hurry.
I'm sorry ... I don't like people touching my blue blanket.  It's not important.  It's a minor compulsion. I can deal with it if I want to. It's just that I've had it ever since I was a baby and ... and ... I find it very comforting.
Where?  What?
What did I do?
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Coney Island??
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is.
What is she gonna do here?
Roger De Bris.  Roger De Bris.  Oh yes, the director.  Is he good... I mean bad?
Only if we ask him.
Watch closely, as Bialystock drives the last nail into the coffin.
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
What???
Mr. Liebkind, wait.  You don't understand.
You're not, as you Americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
Cowards, miserable cringing cowards. Clinging to life like baby butterflies.  Vatch, vatch and remember.  Franz Liebkind vill show you how to die like a man!
Get car.  Get car.
Good.  Let's fool around.  Now, I'll be the innocent little milk maid and you'll be the naughty stable boy.  Oh, this milk is so heavy.  I'll never reach the house.  Help.  Will someone help me?
The Graf Spee...
Heil you know who!
Hey, man, let's stomp Switzerland!
Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
Tell me all about her.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
No! Of all...
What do you mean?
How did she pay you?
Anyone at home?
Casharoonie!
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
Go ahead! Spin it around the block. Now I know you don't know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can't you... and it's all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
Aha! Always got time to argue money, huh...?
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
With you.
No. I take it you don't either?  How long?
A good reason, I suppose.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
I hate tears. 
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
No.
She haven't even called you?
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
I didn't. I got a job, too.  I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
This is the old highway.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
Bates.
Sam. This is the last time.
Sam! No!
I'm all for it! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it's only hard work.  But if I can see you, touch you even as simply as this... I won't mind.
A couple of years and the debts will be paid off. And if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
How can you even think a thing like that!
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
The bathroom.
Thank you. Again.
I'd like to.
Not really. I hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, I mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  Oh, I don't know anything about birds. My hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. And I guess I'd just rather stuff birds because...  well, I hate the look of beasts when they're stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but I can't... I think only birds look well stuffed because they're rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...
I imagine so.
Is your time so empty?
You go out... with friends?
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Only my share.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
No, m'am.
Now wait just a moment! Turn your motor off, please.
You didn't!  It's tinkerbell.  Al wants to be sure he'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  Well come on in, at least!
Let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
He told you he wasn't coming right back cause he wanted to question Norman Bates' mother, right?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates' mother.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Did I?
I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
You say a fortune. He never spoke to me of any rich relatives.
That sounds to me very remarkable.
You're not as quick as I thought. I figgered out that rats breed faster than cats-- cat skins make good fur-- The cats eat rats. Rats eat raw meat. That is, they eat the carcasses of the cats. So --the cats eat the rats--the rats eat the cats. And I get the skins--simple ain't it?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Oh, just the basement. Some day I intend to build an experimental laboratory down there. It will save me from intrusion.
Not so fast, Mrs. Buckley. That was your idea!
Yes.
No?
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
I just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but Ralph is awful sweet.
I met one last night ... all the money this side of Peoria.
He can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
I'd call it stupid at any time.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
I'd love to, at any time.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
Hello, Express. What's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
It happens that I'm the law.
You mean he was colored?
Well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
No, there's another point I want to iron out.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
So you can give me an argument and tell me I'm wrong. Don't be sil, Kid.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
Let it go.
You here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
Say, you're always razzing everything I do, but this is one time I'm in.
What goofy idea have you got now? Don't tell me you suspect Judge Ramsey of stealing the body.
Don't remember what day that was, do you?
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
Thanks.
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
What do you mean police dog?
That's what I said.
Who'd steal her body?
Oh, is that what caused it?
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
You taking any medication?
Dad...
You did miss --
Excuse me???
Okay.
Like now?
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
They were just bad men, that's all.
Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute?
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
Aw, be a good sport, Rose.  You like me, don't you? I like you a lot.
'Course it does.
First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose.
I said I wouldn't.
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
Well, a little.
But how would you find him?
I'll be right back.
No, he doesn't. Not really.
Yeah.
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
So am I.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
Then why does she act so dumb?
It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch.
Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half.
Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you?
Dead, Rose is dead? You mean... she died?
Well, if it isn't malignant and she can get through the operation all right, it might be better than her really being pregnant. She doesn't even know who the father might have been.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Go on, Doctor.
I think we both know her.
What?
Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
I'll take him with me downtown.  And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride.
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
You are the one who's good-hearted.  As for Rose, let's hope for the best.
Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later.
I am not being brutal to her!
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Darlin', it is not my fault if the girl has epizootics --
Now darlin', what has the South got to do with this?
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it!
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Over... my... dead... body!
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Why, I'm not going to kiss you, you crazy girl. Now I'm telling you again, get off my lap. Come on, Rose, get up. Now you get up, I say, and stop this!
No, sir.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
What?
Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her.
It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me?
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
I don't want to start no fight with you, Buddy. Why do you say I'm full of shit?
She used to call me Mr. Right. Remember that, Buddy?
Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years.
A tenant farm? Are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
You can stop it right now.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
You're so sweet.
Yes, ma'am.
You think it's that good?
What and?  That's what I got.
Am I supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
If I tell you, how do I know you won't just club me and take it back?
I need the "when" and the "where."
She's fine, as if you cared.
That wasn't my fault.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
I'm just saying...
I got him.
The ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
Entertainers don't count.
What about him?
You've never heard of Napoleon brandy, Mister Smarty-Pants?  How do you think it got its name?
What day is it?
It's not gonna happen.
What... what kinda thing is that to say?
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
Hey... HEY!    Cool down, Jumbo!
No.
General Jim Beam, then.
What happened, Kittle?  We used to be friends.  You used to know how the game was played.
No.  Don't open your mouth!  You <U>honestly</U> think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
Don't bother.  This behavior's gone on too long.  You're suspended.
Thank you for sharing that charming image.
Just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, doesn't make you any less a murderer.
You think you accomplished something... like you're heroes? Fuck you!   This is meaningless! You'll never win!  You know, as soon as I'm gone... someone's going to take my place.
Second of all, the Declaration of Independence was all for liberty and equality, but it didn't do anything about slavery, did it?
Don't crowd him.
I kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
So there's nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
Do tell.
Well, that's what I heard, and that's what I choose to believe.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the Jedi the way you have, Luke... but the Force is strong with her, as it is with all of your family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy Vader!
Jabba's palace.
As you wish.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader.
Are you all right?
Wouldn't miss it.
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.
Leia!
Hold me.
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.
You, too.
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower.
Your father?
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
If that is your destiny.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.
Unfortunate that I know the truth?
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression. The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Rocky!
Yes.
We must have a blow-out.
Oh don't be so shy.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
You know this earth - this person.
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Now I
That ain't no crime
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
You're too kind.
Creature of the night.
...Fine.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
By accident?
...I suppose.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
I don't think you're a bum.
...Guess.
You sure?
It's fine.
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
'Bout seven.
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
...Yes --
What're we going to do?
...I dunno.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
C'mon, man, it's cold, man.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
I only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- Vegas odds say, 'no.'
Am I seeing right? Creed is approaching the ring in a boat. Is he supposed to be George Washington? Obviously so.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
That's it, I'm broke.
I know the juice is climbin' -- I been workin' six months just to pay the damn interest.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Gonna try.
Rocky.
Excuse me.
What?
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
What?
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Yeah --
Yeah, Kayo.
Ain't they?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
I got pain an' experience too.
I never had good footwork.
...The guy's great.
Yo, Paulie.
Looks, huh?
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
...No.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
You mean the rabbit?  They got him cold.
Sounds like you ve never seen her, Eddie.
A tweeting bird?
Is this paper even good?
Maroon, right?
What the hell would they want with a gag factory?
Yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
Familiar.  Be careful, Eddie.
He had a will, all right.  She took it off Acme the night she and R.K. Maroon knocked him off.  Then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
Why didn't you tell me?
That's what you woke me up for?
Only there's no business like it, no business I know.
No... I'm not.  I'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
Take it easy.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Sorry, Eddie, I forgot you're not a Toon.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
My brother.  Get inside.
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
No better?
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Am I like Such a fellow?
Good-morrow, cousin.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Art thou hurt?
Young Romeo is it?
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
My poverty, but not my will consents.
Hold Daughter!
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
For doting; not for loving, pupil mine.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
Talk not to me, for Ill not speak a word. Do as thou wilt for I have done with thee.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Amen
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Pink for flower.
Right.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir. And you will give me occasion.
I don't know.
And I don't believe you...
I don't know.  I was thinking...Maybe the three of us might partner up -- guns for hire, that sort of thing.
The name is Deirdre, and I'm running this show.
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
You lose them!
Plastic fucking surgeon?  You think I'm going to fix this, Deirdre lass?  It's the mark of the patriot, and I'll wear it like a badge.  As for those who done it to me, I'll take my pound of flesh before this is all over.
Is that right?
These days they they call me Gregor -- and I'm a tech.  I do electronic work, surveillance, computer runs.
In this business, your life and your reputation are more often than not one and the same.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
Really?  Do you have the money with you?
Figured enough to know there's an odd man out and I'm looking at him.
Then where is it?
A post office box.
I've never seen a man who could have taken what he just went through.  He's a cop?
How did you know?
Something important?  A thing that cannot wait?
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
Vincent told you that I'm a cop?
Call it a reckoning of character.
A Samurai has honor, a Samurai live by the code of Bushido, the way of the warrior.  I'm just a killer for hire.  The world isn't about honor, anymore. It's about survival.
Gets the job done.
And you could stand to get a little smarter, ain't that right you dumb blonde fuck?
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
I have a feeling I'm about to start buying my own.
I've seen a lot of people die before.
It isn't about money for me, not anymore.
It's my job.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
It is at that.
You would have done that?
You think?
What of it?  Samurai pain in the ass.
And yet you would have killed him to save my life.  You have a sense of honor, Vincent, that I can't even remember anymore.  I don't know that I ever even had it to begin with.  All I know to do, Vincent, is to finish my job.
I know.
You better get some sleep, alright?
I guess that's for the best.
Just to keep me company, Sam -- I hate smoking alone.  How about you?  I thought all you IRA types smoked.
It's the Irish tape we want.
I might know where you could get a copy.
Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
I want to get some hounds down here.
I don't know what you're -
I hear you.
He would have won more but he blew it at the end.  Didn't know what Cash and Carry was.
We don't know that.
What makes you so sure?
Well neither have I, but it's us or him.  If he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  Besides, he's a low life scumbag.  His kind is hardly even human anyway.
He'll tell them everything to save his ass. That's how they all work it!
What are you thinking?
He's probably made copies.  He's not going to give them up to us.
Do you have everything?
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
I can't.  I can't go on.  I can't keep lying...killing.  That's not me.  That's not US.
My point, well...
All right, Jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
That's the deal.  If you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
What are you doing, Earl?
Hi.
Oh.  You coming by tonight?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
Dammit, I'm so sick of this.
Cause we got footprints leading into that brush, I want to see where it leads...  Jesus, seven dead.  I'll tell you I've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  I don't like it.  Not in my jurisdiction.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Don't you think I would have told you that!
Because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
Mm-hmm...
Have you known this all along?
Well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
What the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
Lingerie...
Well I just uh, you know...
Oh.
Yeah I'd say C...C.
Sure.
He probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
Take it or leave it.
Sort of.
Why?
About what?
Forget it.
Calm down --
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
Well I don't know --
How much is that?
James, you see my kids back there?  You know how much I'm paying for private school?  How can you come in here with this attitude, you being little Chang's godfather?
This is your ship?
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
That's right.
You bring American money?
Oh yes, she's very nice.
Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here?
Those girls drove off because of you.
No.
I'm sorry.
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
I am a tourist.
My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time.
This is a very dangerous man.
I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
Not Yu.  You!
You said --
Follow the RichWhiteMan...
It's your turn!
Take it!
For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides.
What's a Chinese heaven?
How was the sex?
Are you serious?
Forget it.  It doesn't matter.
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
That was the name of Ricky Tan's boat.
No.  I'm going to find out.
I did!
It's okay, I got lots more.
New York City?
What "revenge" is he talking about?
If I'm wrong then my cover is blown.
Now you know.
No.  Freddy Ching's, in Crenshaw.
Nobody can protect me.  I'll make a deal with you, Lee.  But only iff you'll get me out of Hong Kong.
That's probably the only reason Johnson's still alive.
Witnesses.
No.
What the hell kinda cop are you?!
It was my ass that almost got trashed!
What is that, some kind of Chinese proverb?
Yeah, somethin' like that.  OK, now this is a nasty ass place. When you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. You got to maintain control. You following me? You lose it, you get hurt. Now, you're my responsibility and I don't want you hurt. You understand?  OK, let's go.
Come on!
Took off. Yes. They took off.
No! You hate me.  Look, I'm gonna do it one time.  That's it.
Excuse me?
FBI calls up my ass, says they need help in Tokyo.  Like I'm supposed to drop everything.
FBI needs a taste of the street. And I'm it.
This is my city. I'm a cop. I'll find em.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
After I left?
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
It's hurting.
"Sink the putt."
I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
All the gory details.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
Yeah.
Okay, we'll order out.
Not bad.  I was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when Maggie met me.
It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said.
Oh, come on.  You're practically family.
Really?
Well, I'm impressed.  Absolutely incredible.  I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
Of what?
Yes.
I'd rather not.
Really?
So am I.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
Lighten up, what?
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
No, I'm just going to head home.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Good boy, Port Hole.
So you're angry.  Big deal.
It sounds nice.
It's not a boat boat.  It's really a house.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
Am I what they had in mind?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
I'll wait.
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Go to the Symphony --
It's delicious, trust me.
That doesn't make any sense.
Nothing's with me.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Actually, he sounded nice.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
I always wondered about that too.
Is this crazy?
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
No, I'm not. 
A sense of humor.
I want my money.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Mom, we already...
Sure you do --
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
Fair enough.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
It is not --
Right, right.
And that's what I'm trying to tell you.  What women are looking over, okay? Pecs and a cute butt.
What is it?
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
I have forty-two.  So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
It plays in 50 states.
What do you think?
What?
Jonah, I'm leaving --
I was thirsty.
It might be in the kitchen.
Shut up.
Okay.
Well...
Well, here's the number.  If you ever find yourself Sleepless, give us a call.  We also... do babysitting.
Look, I met somebody.  She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off.  We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Oh.
Your foreman says that's a foreman's job.
I've tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
It never ends.
An American.
You're a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty ...
Yes. We will light the candles.
With Ramón it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
What's more important than sanitation?
The safety of the men -- that's more important! Five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. You're a woman, you don't know what it's like up there.
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
I'm going back tomorrow.
Why not? I'm not needed here.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
It's Mama's Saint's Day.
The Junior Shop Stewards. There's lots of ways we can help.
But Papa -- you need all the help you can get.
Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? "Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? They're trying to scare us, that's why -- to make us afraid to move. To hang on to what we got -- and like it! Well, I don't like it I'm not scared ... and I'm fed up -- to here!
What attitude?

You like that?
Because I don't know him and I don't really know you, partner.
I understand. Thanks anyway.
That bad, huh?
It's not that easy.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
You can still work.
You always been this stubborn?
I just can't. Okay?
Look, maybe you oughta' leave.
Nothing could be worse then this slow death I'm living now.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Your daughter needs you.  Go.
Can you do me a favor? This girl I know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. I promised her I'd try to help.
Twelve
Oh ... that.  Ah, he was just juiced. He wouldn't have did nothin'
Don't get carried away.
I find myself in dire need of some cash.
10%.  That's ...
Palmdale
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
I think on account of his nose.
You're going to have to explain that one.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
This isn't like that Queen Elizabeth question, is it?
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
What does that mean?
The good stuff.  Can you handle that?
Secret recipe.
If you say so.
Big Bill
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Don't you wonder why I do it?
I was trying to score some dope.
Okay, asshole, you wanna play, we'll play.
This chink have a name?
No. You just handed us a new one.  We can go Federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. Intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  What's the mandatory on that, Al?
Yeah. Okay. Listen carefully ...  You're in the bathroom.  You've been shot in the shoulder ...
It speaks!
Dude is bugging.  Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
Hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
Garcetti, you're teeth, they're fucking perfect.
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
Thank you.  Thank you very much.
I was talking about Miles.
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Hell, no, last time I shot a corporal, Cap'n Miller near bit my head off.
Of course, sir.
I think I'm we got that eighty-eight.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
Keep trying.
Senator's son?
But you could have gotten killed and I...
I'll tell you what, if I'm still alive when it hits five-hundred, I'll let you know and we'll split the money.
What do they know?  I had nine, but I feel through the ice when I was seven, my brother pulled me out.  Then I used one when a grenade landed in my foxhole in Sicily, it was a dud.  I figure one on the beaches, one on the cliffs and two getting here.
Those guns are close.
That's better, but you've still got a long way to go.  Talk to Reiben, he's a natural and works at it, he'll give you some pointers.
Rolls his eyes, takes a breath. Scrambles into the gap.  The other five right behind.
I wish.  You and I are taking a squad up to Ramelle on a public relations mission.
What about the company?
Okay, Wade.  Translators?
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
And what about you?
It doesn't take this.
Vecchio.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
She's the best poker player you ever saw.  My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt.  Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost.  She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands.  And he bluffs?  He had sixteen levels of bullshit.  Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master.  She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
Yes, sir.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Ours is not to reason why.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
But I am a captain.  If I were not a captain, I would thank you for the compliment and tell you that the ability to lie comes from being a top-notch poker player, which I am, having learned at the side of my mother who is, by popular acclaim, the best poker player in...
I don't like that one.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Yes, sir.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
Upham and Jackson, what were they like?
No, I just happen to take the Captain's advice and look at the bright side of things.
Who knows?  It worked.
Shit, that's nothing, I ran twenty- two flat.
This evening is over.
And your former wife.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Jesus Christ.  I get in a good mood.  How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Yeah.
I just washed this shirt, didn't I?
I'll be home soon.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
I just saw Joe.  He's here.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I love you dad.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss.  You stand up straight and admit you're special.
Okay, I give up.
Do you wanna make things easier on me?  Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit.  You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
You're going.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
I like him a lot.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Honey!
I made their lives better.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
Look at those eyes.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Well, not monumentally.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party.  This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Goodbye.
Bye.
Well... just meet her.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Don't worry about it.  We're just having coffee.  We'll be anti- social.
Yeah.
Your letter came yesterday.
What's wrong?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
Okay.
Not right now, thanks.
Hello.  May I please speak with Diane please?
How ya doing?  Is she around?
How do you pay for one of those?
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
I know
I know this part, keep reading.
You missed every one of your career counselling sessions.  Call me obsessive, compulsive, but let's do this right now.
I was gonna...
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
You must chill!  You must chill!  I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
It's up to you.
It's bad business.
I don't know.  Soon.
All you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  What's a person worth to you.
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
You asked for shoe polish.
Look it up.
God bless you, sir.
I need a drink.
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
Did I threaten anybody here?  I stated a simple fact.
I think most people right now have other priorities.
Something they can hold in their hands.
Better this month than last?
Yes.
Ah, yes.
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
What other point is -
Give or take what, Stern - how many - count them.
Yes.
Well, sure.  So would I.  So would you. I wouldn't worry about it.  We'll get it right one of these days.
I didn't do enough.
Would it do any good?
Hang up...call...
I'm losing you.
Okay, okay. I'll call now. I'll call you back.
"Drink with your brain." That's our motto. Who are you calling for?
It helped me realize one thing.
Please, Cotton, dont do this.
Not until youre dead.
Where is Sidney's father?
I'll get my jacket.
You weren't supposed to leave her alone.
The way I see it. Well be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
Can we turn the light on?
Over here.
He filmed his victims.
There's nothing. I'm coming down.
Yeah, right.
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
No, Gale, I'm just getting started. Seeya soon.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
My morn was a Delta.
Yes, goddammit!
I have to watch rehearsal.
Sig Ep's gotta band, tonight.
It's okay. Look, Hallie, I'll meet you outside.
No, no, I hadn't planned on going, it's just Mickey will be pissed.
I'd really just like to be alone.
You fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
Guys, guys, I'm sorry but, no way.
Gale?
But she's standing right next to you.
Sssshhh. ON SCREEN The phone RINGS. The young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. She grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
You are so not funny.
Sandra started without us. We can stay. He kisses her again, then breaks away.
He's after me.
Do you work for her now?
Me, too. Randy. Me too.
Oh I wouldn't miss it for the world. I bet you did such a great job.
Who is this?
Who is this?
Thanks.
What kind of a game?
There's more.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
In my fifteen years as a homicide detective I've never met a single soul as pushy and brazen as you are Miss Weathers.
Yeah, but, if I'm not mistaken, you said in your book that Sidney got it wrong before. She accused Cotton Weary of murdering her mother, and he was sent away for it!  Maybe there is a third killer.  Sidney Might know something
Actually, there was more this time. This time, we found a picture too.
What did you know about your mother?
Here's the deal, I'm off to search the soundstage. That's good news.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
What Rielly?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
DEWEY! IT'S GALE!
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Why would the police come to you?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
So it's off to London for a week?  New York for a month? L.A Forever?
I'm sorry, this is too good!
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
And who is that?
Jennifer?! Wait, where are you going off to?
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Sure, why not. You did Save my life,Mr. Rielly.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
I know right. It was kinda weak. That's cause Will Kennison only wrote a rough treatment of it. The script was written by some new guy. He wrote Arlington Street.
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
I don't think so!  Just what happened to Maureen when she was in Hollywood?
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Hey I really liked that piece you did on me last month. The one where you said my car accident was caused by me drinking and drugs, and how I faked the tire blow-out just so my insurance wouldn't sky rocket.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
What are you talking about?
I know!
Let's get out of here!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Oh my God, Angie Crick? From English class?
And still the film is Number One at the box office this weekend. Beat out American Pasty and Arlington Street.
I'm just saying, though. What if there's someone out there stalking actors? Huh? Then what?
Damn. He called my roommate and told her he had some important things he wanted to go over with me in his office tonight.
How do I know their voices are --
Laura I think I just killed somebody.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Thanks, butt wart. You did good.
I was just asking. Why are you always at me?
No, it's not.
Where the fuck did she go?
See, it couldn't have been me. I was in jail, remember?
Your parents split up. It's not the same thing. Your mom left town, she's not in a coffin somewhere.
Sure it is, Sid. It's all a movie. Life's one great big movie. Only you can't pick your genre.
What?
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
What number is this?
I don't think so.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
So, you gotta boyfriend?
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
That's not what you said.
Don't...
Sure...
I'm telling you the truth. I lied before...
That all depends on you.
No... please.
YES!
NOOOO....
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
Your call.
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
We haven't ruled out that possibil...
That's quite alright. If I may say so, ma'am, you're much prettier in person.
What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist...
At the airport.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
I don't know. I guess.
Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas.
Afraid not.
Should I be worried?
He's her boyfriend.
What about the cellular phone bill?
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
You want to go live?
He was drunk that night. He left his coat at your house, after your mother seduced him...
Maybe she's a slut just like her mom.
What am I doing?
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
LEAVEMEALONE!
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Got it.
Did you really put her liver in the mailbox? I hear they found her liver in the mailbox.
It was all a misunderstanding. He didn't do anything.
Because, obviously they don't watch enough movies. This is standard horror movie stuff. PROM NIGHT revisited.
There goes my chance with Sid.
Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Yeah, yeah... are you okay?
I'm not worried.
How does that get you in the mood with Stu?
I did. He's full of shit.
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
Announcing what?
What are you talking about?
You know that's not true.
Spit it out.
Because I envy your normal life.  Envy is my sin.
Let me tell you how I want this to go.  I want you to look, and I want you to listen.
You always have to find one singular thing to focus on.  There's always one thing, and it may be as small as a speck of dust, but you find it and focus... till it's an exhausted possibility.
I read.  Remember reading?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
And, if it's a threat.
We put her in a safe house.
For now, let's just consider the books as the murderer's inspiration. The books and sermons are about atonement for sin.  And, these murders have been like forced attrition.
Even if they did, those photos were taken before forensics.
A switchblade.
In this city, if all the skeletons came out of all the closets... if ever hidden body were to suddenly rise again, there'd be no more room for the living.
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
We have to divorce ourselves from emotions here.  No matter how hard it is, we have to stay focused on the details.
They pay cops for the inside scoop, and they pay well.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
No.
We don't know for sure...
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
You got to be kidding.
If you want to know who's been reading Paradise Lost, Purgatory, and say... The Life and Time of Charlie Manson, the Bureau's computer will tell you.  It might give us a name.
I don't.  Neither do you.
What happened?
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
Call for help, and you'll live.  But, you'll be disfigured.  Or, put yourself out of your misery.
I can tell you this.  I recognize his lawyer.  His name's Mark Swarr.
What did you say?
Put the gun down, Somerset!
I can't do this now... please.
Really?
I want to have children.  It's just...
You fit a lot of descriptions.
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
You got one now!
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
I'm Clayton.
Ain't been too good...No sir, not too good...Gettin' old, Ethan...
Where's Scar, Mose...SCAR?
Keep talking.
If they're still alive...
Sorry...We don't even know if Debbie 'n Lucy are with this bunch...Maybe they split up...
Good night.
Yeah, I kinda figgered you'd say that...Bein' a new husband and all...
What's the sense in it!
Debbie, you're comin' with us! Hear me?
It's what I'm countin' on.
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
I got your boy killed.
No...not yet...
Ain't worth the mendin'...
Shush!...Time for bed anyway...  Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
You'll never get away from me!
Oh, damnit!
Do you have a better idea?
Yes, daddy.
Cherry-red Tears.
What?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
An animal?  What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
Hi, darling.
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
I've killed my husband!
Ladies and gentlemen: The "Straub country-residence".
Tenth floor.
And the title of this piece?
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Yes.
I had the Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.
Tomorrow.
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
Ask him.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
I will play him. Bring it tomorrow.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
No, no. You have a wife, children
Partners!
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Yes, but very well.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Who wrote that?
I did not.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
How will it?
What do we do now?
Go on.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
The daughter of his enemy.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
He looks well enough for a mountebank.
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
What do you love so much?
Above Lord Wessex?
But your voice  Have they dropped?
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
"Sin from my lips? Oh trespass sweetly urg'd. Give me my sin again."
She will breed. If she do not, send her back.
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
I have, Master Shakespeare.
Who is there?
If they find you here they will kill you.
Oh
And that was only my first try.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
Oh--no, no!
I must. I must
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
I was the more deceived.
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
Write me well.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.  You are allowed to show your pleasure.
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
Does she say so?
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
You are on my ground.
Just serve.
I haven't lost yet.
Can I show you something?
No.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I can't do it.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
Just stop worrying.
There was a break-in.
You're not eating.
We just wanted to speak to you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
I beg your pardon?
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
Where will we go? Where will we go? Juliet?
It looks like he's writing everything down.
Well, then?
And if I told you their car was parked outside, would that surprise you?
Yes.
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
I think you're lying.
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?
What's he doing here?
It tastes different.
Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --
He can't stay up there.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Yeah, he's got to go to work, hasn't he? You think he'll come down for that?
And the money?
Where he can't get it?
No.
Oh.
It's the only way.
I see.
You mean I can have the room?
Burglary?
Can we come in?
Do you smoke?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
It was on the television.
Oh, don't be so coy, dear. You're going to Rio.
Accounting, David, chartered accounting --
That's what I thought.
What's it about?
It's a breeze.
No. But he needs treatment.
A certain weakness.
I write about it?
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Chicken salad, Devra!
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
I know.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Well she...
That headboard.
No.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
I guess so.
Hello.
Yeah.
I do her hair, yeah.
Chopped liver?
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Yeah.
Great.
And you need money?
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
He's a very private person, actually.
Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
Yeah, I think so...
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
I won't screw you up.
You're a genius.
You don't think so? I do.
He still having parties?
He never stopped.
Nothing.
Look who's talking.
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Look about last night --
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
What's that supposed to mean?
Don't go, Jackie...
She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
You were supposed to handle that bitch, she's always asking for you, and she was furious you weren't here.
What with?
Okay... thanks...
What's gonna happen?
Now, George --
Honey, what happened?
You're great.
Yeah, baby.
Okay...  Night, baby.
How did it go at the bank?
Going where?
I'll call you.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Commercials.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
How many?
I just want to know, that's all.
-- please, baby --
Yes, yes, I did.
What did you say?
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
Thank you.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
You're right.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
Oh, hey...
I don't know what to...
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
Well, what?
What, do you think I planned it?
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Have a drink.
Okay, thanks.
Wasn't sure it was you.
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
I'll call you back...
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.
I was too old.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Is that right?
Who do you think I was talking to?
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know what's wrong.
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Oh yeah?
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
I'm exaggerating.
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
But why Egypt?
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Sort of.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
Of course not.
You're going.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
-- just wonderful.
Yes, Dad.
Is there something bad here?
Okay.
Okay, Mom.
All right.
Yeah.
Danny... what's the matter, hon?
Are you having a bad dream?
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
This is Dick Halloran, our Head Chef.
Nice to meet you.
Well I guess I probably heard you call him that.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Well, I'm looking for a change.
Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
And you didn't see anything at all?
I can't really remember.
Yes...
Of course you are.
Wendy!
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Well...
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
Well, my predecessor in this job
Well, it's very... homely.
Oh, it's beautiful.  My God, this place is fantastic, isn't it hon?
Thank you, Susie.
Hi.
Fine.
When me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Brady's a booger and so are you!
And my dad says it's kids. But it's not rats and it's not kids. It's-
Yeah.
What if it's some kind of monster?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
What about the baseball bat Jane saw in his shed? You know who used to have a baseball bat like that? Mr. Knopfler! He was so proud of it he used to carry it in the Fourth of July parade! Jane said it looked like the Green Giant used it for a toothpick!
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
Yes... you've always been that to him. But if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
Really?
You know, I just might!
You know what we're saying!
I think they hear you!
Just tell him, I do love you, but I can't -- I'm a nun.
You bastard!
Sure.
That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Oh my! 
Yes, Betty?
WISH HE WAS MINE.  THAT HANDSOME BOY OVER THERE, THE ONE WITH THE WAVY HAIR.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Just about.  Show me again.
You betcha.
That man -- who is he?
It's true -- I know her.
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
I hear you.  How many days a week do you rehearse?
Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert.
A novice.
Right, sure, but what's the problem? Are they keeping you a prisoner here? Do they drug you?  Did Reverend Mother like, kidnap your parents?  We can call the Enquirer.
Keep moving!
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
Enough joking.
You mean black people?
My what?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
No.  No.
And what next?  Popcorn?  Curtain calls? This is not a theater.  or a casino.
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
The majority has spoken.
Perhaps not.  Perhaps we can all use... a little Spandex.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
I am?
Yeah.  You look... great.  I mean it..
How?
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Vince is getting desperate.  Where is she, Eddie?  Where'd you stash her?
You won't even tell us?
So, take it off.
Is it worth it?  A lot of witnesses here.
I need to see you, at once.  Girls, please excuse Sister Mary Patrick for a few moments.  Mary Clarence?
Which convent was that, Sister?
We'll pray -- and she'll be there.
Yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
Christy.
I love you, Chris.  I always will.  I gave you so much.  My time.  My affection.  A big-time career.  And how do you repay me?  What's the thanks I get?  Where's the loyalty, huh?  Where's the love?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there.
The Lenape.  He comes to gawk at civilization from time to time.
You need rest.
Yes, sir... but, do you have these?
It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry.
It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers.
Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it.
I have others.  All I need is this.
Listen.
I hear nothing.
We are far from the Hollow.  Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning.
"Let loose his silent shrieking." Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out.  "He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand." Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
What books?
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
There is no such thing as magic.
Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop?
I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment.
Yes, he does.  May I try?
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
To avenge his father, and the others.
But, why?  Tell me why.
What?
No, but... why do you ask that?
If you think I am behind this, say it.
He moves too fast.
The Horseman.  Yes.
This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me...
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
I fixed it. Hit's a workin' pretty good.
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'll take it out of your pocket anyway.
Well, what did you want?
I got a mama, but she's at work over at Ben's Dollar Store. My daddy's dead.  He got hit by a train.
Well, it's not too big in here, is it?  I feel very generous today. I feel like listening. I'm sure you have plenty to tell me. And please bore me with the details.  ) Come on Karl, who did you kill? Was it the boy?
Yeah She was a big 'un. You ain't drunk drivin' are you Doyle?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
I hate you!
That's funny.  You go to bed and take snot nose with you.
You believe in the Bible?
Childers.
Baptized? Well, get baptized then. I don't give a shit. Call a fuckin' preacher, goddamnit! I can't baptize you.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
How do you know?
Yeah, I did.
Two people.
He ort not to talk that away to you neither. He ain't no count. He's mean to you and your mama.  Yore mama and that feller that's carryin' me to get somethin' d'eat's gonna be back here directly.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Naw.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
Yeah.
You're strong though. You let me make them touchdowns so I'd feel good. My daddy used to do that kind of thing.
No sir.
Don't go home tonight and stay with that Doyle. He's got it in for ye tonight. I got me a feelin', too. Feels like to me you ort not be there in that house with him liquored up and mean. Ye mama neither. When you get up from here, I want you to go to that feller's house. Your mama's friend. I want you to give me your word on it.
Ever'thing's okay, boy. I kindly want to put my arm around ye for a minute and then I'm gonna go on and leave here.
They ain't even no good. The only one can play is Randy Horsefeathers. He claims he's an Indian. His real name's Randy Collins and he works at the feed mill. He can at least play guitar.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
You better go get your things.
I want to come back and stay here.
Your daddy's still livin' down there from what you told me.  I guess he wouldn't help you any, would he? I wasn't thinking. You don't know anybody?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
My history.
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
I like Frank. He's a good boy. Me and him's made friends.
That's what I thought. I hope I haven't offended you in any way. You seem like a thinker. You seem to always be in deep thought. Tell me something. What are you thinking right now?
Oh. How about before that?
I ain't read 'em yet except two or three of 'em. I can't understand a lot of what I try to read. My mind, hit wonders off to somethin' else when I try to read.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
Karl is a guy guy?
I'm sorry.
Why won't he talk to women?
Karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the Easter Collage.  Melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? You girls want some coffee?
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
Where will he go?
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
It's my birthday.
No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
Good. I hope you like it. It was a long time in coming.
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
Definitely.  I suppose it all goes back to Queen Elizabeth.
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry too.  It took me three years to save up those five thousand bucks, and now I'm broke. I can't hardly pay for this beer. Not to speak of having my credibility destroyed. Do you understand what I'm saying? My credibility. So yeah, I'm sorry, too. About as sorry as I've ever been in my whole fucking life.
Fuck you, kid.
Christmas stories? Sure, I know a ton of 'em.
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I wouldn't say that. But at least you've put the camera to good use.
Yes, I suppose I do.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
Look, I'm not saying you don't have a daughter. It's just that she's not my daughter.
No you're not.
For keeps?
It's pretty crazy, don't you think? I mean, a smart guy like you. What do you want to hang on to a dead-end job like this for?
I should stop smoking these damn things is what I should do. The fuckers are going to kill me one day.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
They come in, they go out. I've got it planned to the last detail.
Seventeen? I remember when I was seventeen. Christ, I was one little whacked-out son-of-a-bitch when I was seventeen. Is that what you are, son? One little whacked-out crazy fella?
And why the hell would you give me money?
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
The refrigerator?
It'll keep them fresh. If they get too dry, they'll break. And you don't want that to happen, do you?  Tobacco is a plant, and it needs the same loving care you'd give an orchid.
Damned if I know. But it has a nice ring to it, don't it?
The damn lock's broken again.  And so you just barge in on strangers, is that what you do? Is that your game?
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
As far as I know, he went back to his parents.
I shouldn't have let him go.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this.  A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
I'm working on a sketch. That old garage of yours is so rundown, it's kind of interesting.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
I don't know. I try. Every day I keep on trying, but it's no easy task for a man to change his nature.  I'm off the booze, though. Haven't had a drop in six years. And now I've got me a wife. Doreen. Best damned woman I've ever known.  And a little boy, too. Cyrus Junior.  So things have definitely improved since I got fitted with this hook. If I can just turn this goddamn garage around, I'll be in pretty good shape.
Aren't you going to say anything?
I don't know, Tommy. You think anyone gives a rat's ass about Kuwait? I read something about the head sheik over there. He marries a different virgin every Friday and then divorces her on Monday. You think we want to have our kids dying for a guy like that?
I don't drink coffee.  On the other hand, since you insist, if you offered me a cold lemonade. I wouldn't say no.
Look, kid, it's okay with me. You don't have to play games. If you want a hamburger or something, go ahead and order it.
You don't know me from a hole in the wall.
In Manhattan?
I can take care of myself. Don't worry.
No, he was a schoolteacher. But he liked to dabble.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Let's not get too idealistic.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
Pick two or three. Now that the coffers are open, you might as well take advantage of me.
His only copy.  I mean, if you think you're going to die, what's more important, a good book or a good smoke? And so he huffed and he puffed, and little by little he smoked his book.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
If you don't tell me what happened, how do you expect me to know that? I need facts, not opinions.
Now ask him who his mother was.
Do you have real iced coffee, or do you just pour hot coffee over some ice cubes?
You want another one of these, too?
Oh, yeh?
That's obvious.
Well, if the blood got <u>onto</u> the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
They fished t'gether.  Went to school. Carl Junior treated him like a white person.  Like any friend.
Is that your third question?
You done your math right.
Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks.
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  Yes?
Closer to eight.
Easy.  Slow is best.
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
I did.  But the jury won't s...
So.  Wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  Did you find him eager?
You bet.  And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
He didn't want to lose any more.
Carl Heine came.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
Shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  Nobody ever looks. Just take up space.
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  No one knows.
Have a look.  At nothing.
I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Well.  It shows the prosecutor was wrong.  It was <u>Carl's</u> boat that was dead in the water.  Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
And what do you believe?
Does it now?
If the head was moving fast enough, but I don't see how it could be.
I wouldn't say encouraged.
He had no reason to.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Such as?
That's the way I like 'em - big and sassy.  And get rid of your roommate.
Beat it, Buster.
The one-legged jockey said - 'Don't worry about me, baby.  I ride side-saddle.'
Dentist?  We been out of work for four months - and you want to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
Don't look now - but the whole town is under water!
So I had to rush him to the hospital and give him a transfusion...  Right?
We're not too late, are we?
Yeah, that's what he means. Good old Nellie!  I ought to wring her neck!
It's twelve bucks.  We can get one of the overcoats out of hock.
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Shave our legs, stupid.
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
Now you've done it!
You better come help me.
You tore it again!
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
But suppose I got to go - like for a drink of water?
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
And I'm not even pretty.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
This happens to me all the time in public.
Yes - you have to be very careful about picking a roommate.
Then we'll get a quick annulment - he'll make a nice settlement on me - I'll have those alimony checks coming in every month -
I'm a boy - I'm a boy - I wish I were dead - I'm a boy - I'm a boy -  What am I going to do about my engagement present?
Wait a minute - lets not be hasty. After all, we don't want to hurt poor Osgood's feelings.
Get it while you're young.  And you better fix your lips.  You want to look nice for Osgood, don't you?
What?
Get me Room 414.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Drop her a postcard.  Any minute now those gorillas may be up here -
What did we do?  Joe, you're not pulling one of your old tricks.
First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If there's anything I can do for you -
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Anything wrong?
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
You betcha.
But there's one thing I envy you for.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Do you suppose she went out shopping?
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Thirty-four.
What's the big idea?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
Personally, I'm Type O.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Most of the time I slap it.
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.
About that roadhouse -
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Flower girl.
But you don't understand!  I'm a MAN!
It's three weeks in Florida -
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
I used to sing with male bands. But I can't afford it any more.
Me?
Bingo?
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
I can tell you one thing - it's not going to happen to me again.  Ever. I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop.
About what?
What's in Florida?
Going to catch yourself a rich bird?
What makes you so sure?
Thank you.
Who are you?
Your face is familiar.
Possible you saw it in a newspaper - or magazine - Vanity Fair -
Your view of what?
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
You're society girls?
Yeah.  Real hot.
They do indeed.  Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent, but I don't care. It was such a bore - coming-out parties, cotillions -
I beg your pardon?
Oh, I didn't hear you come in.
Bon voyage.
It's the crews' night off.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
You poor, poor boy.
Thanks just the same.
I have.  Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud - flat on my back -  - then there were the Mayo Brothers - and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths - if I weren't such a coward, I'd kill myself.
I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.
Look, it's terribly sweet of you to want to help out - but it's no use.  I think the light switch is over there -  - and that's the radio.  It's like taking somebody to a concert when he's tone deaf.
They told me I was caputt - finished - washed up - and now you're making a chump out of all those experts.
Where to?  South America?  Oh. That is unexpected.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
He was the first nice guy I ever met in my life - and the only one who ever gave me anything.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
If you want to, you can call your lawyer.
Why?
Because the day after the shooting you sent in a pair of spats - they had blood on them.
Quit kidding.  You did that vulcanizing job on Toothpick Charlie - and we know it.
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
Refresh my memory.
Why wouldn't I?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
Well, we all got to go sometime.
Theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Are you sure youre okay?
Your probably best off pretending youre asleep.
Im sure General Eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  Oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the Fletcher-Wootens.
It was just after we moved here. My little girls got in a fight over Tony Pee-Pants and they havent made up since.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now shes getting married.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Shrink, actually.
Maybe not her least... Theres always--
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. Thats why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
You have feet?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because youre so cute, Ill take care of our incidentals.
You stand on your tiptoes.
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
Okay.
Oh, come on. Youre like the Yoda of escorts.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Sure, but its never easy. They say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, theyre not.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Thank you.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Just drunk enough.
You don't live around here, do you?
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
Where is Africa, Miss Johnson?
But where is my daddy!?
And so you did your job, right?
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
It was too dark, Daddy.
You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
Yes, sir...
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
My father taught me...
Act like one!
Why don't you try and git you a new dog?
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
No mam -- I looked all over.
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
I'll walk...
I'm used to it.
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
To the commissary to get this boy some clothes! I'm gon' get everybody somethin'!
Don't tell me nothin' 'bout what we owe ol' man Howard! I'll do the owing, and let him worry 'bout the collecting! Come on, David Lee!
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
I am the clitoris.
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
I said -
That book wasn't Canadian!
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?
And she's getting worse...
I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian server... I've got to break into the main frame...
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
What Cartman?!
No way.
Mph rm rmph!!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Oh.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone licks your ass for-
Huh?
This will be very dangerous... Are you quite sure?
Uhh...
Baba mama!
Get everyone in hell ready. When the blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the day is ours!
Boobie... This is the only way you're ever going to learn. I have an opportunity here to teach you about consequences.
FREEZE!!
No. Zey must have zem inside. We will have to dig.
Careful? Was my mother careful when she stabbed me in the heart with a clothes hanger while I was still in ze womb?
Yeah, so what do we say?
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Yes ma'am!
No, it was worse than that...
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
This little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  You are a bad man!
I am.
No I'm being serious! Those Canadian entertainers are to be killed. It is the seventh sign.
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
You don't care.
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
And the butfor?
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
Oh yeah...
Oh Sara...
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
Well you did the right thing Mac.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
Uh...
I can hardly wait.
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
10-4 good buddy.
The others decided to get cute with me, so I'm teaching them a lesson!
Fat chance of that.  Even if we had C4 and a laser torch these doors wouldn't budge.  That son of a bitch...that stupid son of a bitch.
Just considering our options... sir.
I don't know the condition of the compartments.  Depending on damage, debris...could be a fatal mistake.
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Close every door behind you!
I can't!
Hopefully sooner than later.
Over and out.
And so far.
Marry you?
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
I know but we're in a bind.
Nope.
It belonged to my dad.
It's splitsville for you.
Sure, Sid.
Don't worry about the Congress, they're just a bunch of moralistic busy-bodies.
What do you think I can do?
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
Not for me. Miniature golf's for pansies.
I'm your blood.
I am underground.
Clam it!
It feels good to let it out, doesn't it? Sheila leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Who's there?
It's not an "Alley". I hate when people call it a "Bowling Alley", it's so common! I prefer "Bowling Center".
Nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without Miles Kastle knowing about it. You don't mind if I have a word with Theo, do you bunny? Kastle takes Theo by the elbow and pulls him away.
Why would you help me?
I think Buzz is retiring soon. In fact, I think he's retiring tonight. Kastle pulls out a shiny gold credit card and holds it in front of Sheila.
After we eat, Dad.
Now swing it out a little to the right...
Who wants to know?  Zeus!
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
He's my father, Millie.
Mine, and they never tip.
Yeah, Babylon. Buzz runs the lanes there for my dad. Everybody who has anything to do with bowling in this town answers to my dad. Theo splits.
Business.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
He follows me, he tries to have sex with me, and then they send him to the nut-hut for a while and then he gets out and then he follows me, he tries to have sex with me, they send him to the nut-hut for a while...
Do you have a boyfriend?
No. Do You?
Plan B is your dad.
Really? I kinda like it.
My mom told me not to stay in this town.
Come on, bargain with me.
I can't tell you, Theo.
What the hell did you go doing that for Sheila? We haven't even gotten naked yet!
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
You think I'm dumping you to get back into bowling. Well who's dumping who?
If you wanna do business in this town, there's other people around here got more weight than old Faz.
Wait a minute --
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Forgive me.  I've never read the Navy manual.  I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
What was that?
Forty yards.
That's our reserve air.
Do you see it?
Now!
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
What team?
The usual.  Plane crash.  Survivers unknown.  Routine stuff really.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Then why am I here?
Maybe older --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
It's impossible.
Maybe so.  But I think we need to ask Jerry about it.
Well, where the fuck is he?
Then how can it be chipped?
Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find?
Please watch your closest monitor...
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
I'm in charge.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction.
What is it?
Give him a chance.  He's speaking our language, not the other way around.
Wait -- down where?
A bad one.  It was the only book in there.  Norman, come here, look at this.
Yeah, it was awful.
Wait a minute.
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
Beth --
In Edmunds' things.
Why should I go?
You press a button, Norman.  It's not brain surgery.  Here, go ahead.  You only have 15 minutes to reset it.  Go on, Norman...
This being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
You think, in the sphere --
But how?
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
Only lab rats.  Here.
Your watch.
Do you fear them?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat.  For defense.  For the power.  To protect myself.
Is it?
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
Promise what, Norman?  Tell me!
Leave me alone, Norman.
I never said that.
You're staring at me.
No I'm not.  I'm not star--
Wait a second, I --
Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see.
It's like...
What are they?
Is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
Help me lift her.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Gimme a second --
Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here!
Well, press something!
Nine hundred feet to surface.
But it's impossible.
Salt's good for you, Ted.  Helps you from getting impotent.
See?  No code.  What'd I say?
No, they didn't say --
Really?
Don't you see it?  It's a picture of the creature.
Unless it's an act.
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
The planet has been totally blown away!  It would have taken a thousand ships with a lot more fire power than I've ever seen... If the Empire had a new weapon that could do this... I would have heard something... I'd know about it.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
Not bad.
May the Force be with you.
Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I'm afraid it's been a long time since the White Legions roamed the stars.  But I have the memories.
But you are... I know your 'Diary of the Clone Wars' by heart.  My father...
What do you mean?
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
They use the Bogan Force.
Have you been checked out?
Forget it, son.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
The fourth moon of Yavin.  I've given the coordinates to Chewbacca.
You're good with 'remotes,' but how are you against something living?
Move out of the way!
You'll get no information from me. You have no authority... the council can't hold me!
I will, but I'll have enough time to transmit my application first.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
It's what I deserve.
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
What about it, Diz ?
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit, Rico ?
Others are waiting.
You got it bad.
Dizzy wouldn't want our tears. She'd want us to remember her... with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy. Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
This isn't simulation anymore. Take'er out easy, cadet.
Oh, I see... teamwork.
Three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
You and me, huh ?
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
Who ?
I'll go for that.
I love you.
I'm not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass the planet !
Yes, ma'am.
Captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
Uh, look, Diz...
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
You used to dance...
Roughneck patrol to battle group... Roughneck patrol to battle group...
Looks like rain.
Must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
Doesn't look like it to me.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
Landing zone is extremely hostile. Come down on this transmission !
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
V'ger will comply if the carbon units disclose the information.
<U>Answer</U>!
Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units.
More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
You are what...?
-- You, personally, are assuming command?
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
You saved the ship.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
Sir, you haven't logged a single star hour in two and a half years. That, plus your unfamiliarity with the ship's design -- in my opinion, sir, seriously jeopardizes our mission.
You asked my opinion, sir.
That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed <U>no</U> emotion, only...  ... pure logic.
That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that <U>killed</U> Ilia!
A tractor beam...
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
We're already two settings below that, sir.
We're hoping it's only a temporary problem, Admiral...
Instruments fluctuating, Captain. Patterns unrecognizable.
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information.
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
To you, sir?
Go you Huskies?
Don't be so hard on yourself.
Yes.
But, but but but...
Of <u>mercy</u>...off...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
But how do I...how do I do a film called "The Old Mill," when I don't have an old mill?
About <u>conflict</u>...
I...
Me?
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
That's for sure.
Fix my glasses.
It's for your finger.
Why?
Then I'll come back, then.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
Why?
Go you Huskies!
<u>Please</u>...
...yes.
Not without a rolltop desk.
Well ain't you amazing.
They'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
I...I <u>think</u> that's right...
I'll knit you a sweater.
Morning, darling.
Sure, but...ten thousand dollars.  Do you know what they...this movie is budgeted at fifty <u>million</u> dol...they're coming up here, offer us a measl...
Where have you been...
I wasn't doing business.
I'm sorry.
Why, you <u>whore</u>!
Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the fragments of glass out of Bob Barrenger's actual head myself.
They think it's your First Wife...
She wasn't in the...
And a <u>fantasy</u> object...
I <u>know</u> my lines...
But, that's the way of the world, huh? Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the world.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?

I...
What I...
Well, yeah, I'm fine, I reached over to, the girl had to be home, I don't know, it's a <u>schoolnight</u>, something...
I've always seen that.
Well.  What seems to be the...?
Of course he...
...I have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  I'm really sorry, Sir, it's a formality, I hope you'll excuse...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
If there's anything I...
There's other things to be learned.
Thank you.
I, well, you know, I tried to take him, in his room.
Well, what's the beef?
I wasn't in the car.
We know that you weren't.
I really think that <u>business</u>...matters should be discussed between you t...
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
Look, look, I like you <u>very much</u>...
But not that <u>way</u>...
Oh.
Will you help me out...?
No, no...Please.
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
I can't do it, Walt.
Now, look.  Claire:  Listen to me.  I want to tell you a story.
And you know what...?
An artist of your caliber...
That isn't very nice.
Why not?
<u>Did</u> I?  I think you're mistaken.
Why?
Doug...
This young woman.
How about that.
He should be put in jail.
Oh, that's <u>great</u>.  Let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
I...
We can't shoot the Old Mill.
I grew up on your mov...
I know you do.
I don't drink.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
I have to tell the truth.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
What did you say to them...?
My oh my.
How was your flight?
What's in all the bags?
Pay her off.
We don't have the money.
There's no witnesses...
I signed the permit.  I don't know how I can.
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Why would they be illegal?
I <u>am</u> the City Council.  We meet Friday, and I...
No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a lot of people are pretty upset...
You think so?
Zat true?
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
I killed her!
Mass hysteria.
Or blush.  You look pale.
Daddy and I tried hard.  We really did.
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
A debate.  Man's inhumanity to woman.  He's pro women.  I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
Actually.  I could only help him.
Oh, yeh.
Don't. Take me with you.
Never mind.  I'll just eat my lunch.
Hold lunch!
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
Thank you Ben.  That was so sweet of you.  Goodnight Annabelle.  Sweet dreams.
&quot;And a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
Doo-wop-doo-doo, <u>doo</u>-wop-doo-doo...
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Rachel's job is she works.
That's Rache's song!
Heaven.  I have to tell him he's made a mistake.  He should take Grammy Martha first.  Or Grandpa Norman.
So where are you?
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
And when did that pass?
Every day.  More and more.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Sooner than later.  You really need to.
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Something's up wi...
Rachel's not half my age.
I'll call from work.  We can have a conference call.
Good...Well...Take care.
Jackie, <u>we</u> were taking them water- skiing for the <u>whole</u> weekend!
But he hasn't.  He wandered off.  I know it's terrifying.  I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
Just not to me.
WE'RE still their parents for the next hundred years.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
It's good.  You're not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
We don't have any coffee.
Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again.
I didn't do it for you.  Believe me.
Fine, forget it.
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
Yes?
That.  And.  Annabelle is over her head.  With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
You look sick.  But you look... together.  Mentally tough.
You mean, after I'm dead?
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Don't flatter yourself.  I always liked that line.
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
We have to talk.
For what?
They don't hate you --
Rache, it may take time.
Great, wallow in guilt, you <u>sure</u> you're not Jewish?
I made that paella you liked. It's on the stove.
Hold your applause.  We're not having fun, here.
I needed some time away.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Oh, yeah?
What?
Really? Well, all right! Let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Speak English.
Maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
I know!
For rape and murder.
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
We're not ready.
We're not ready!
Boys, take napkins...Napkins...
You started filling out your college applications yet?
I dunno.
But it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
You know he hated my story also.
Yeah...How do we know we won't be exploited?
Tired of this shit...
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
You're welcome.  Dad?Would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
Well, now you have.
Ni...
'Fuck me hard!'
'OK.' So you just don't care.  Let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? I mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
Well, I mean...I wanna be on TV. Maybe have a talk show or something. Like Conan. Or early Letterman.
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Prnceton.
Sureumyeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Yeah. He went to Harward.
If you're working for me you're going to do what I tell you.
We're outta here--
Yeah and we don't have much ammo either!
What do you think?
What happened?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Are the labs in operation?
It's nothing to worry about.
Yes, you should.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
I haven't been briefed on any such thing!
Agreed--let's move it.
Dissent?
We can't--it's power driven!
We've...been developing a product... KZ 70709.
Yes, of course.
That's nonsense, and you know it!
And surely you don't expect us to let you spy in our country before you destroy your weapons.
We have many splendidly deep mines in our country.
Give that back to me.
One, two...  three, four...  five...  Why you, dirty, stinking...
Colonel, remember, a reprimand from the President can be pretty serious to a career officer...Just a second, operator, I know I have it somewhere.
What is your name, young lady?
Yes!  Who the hell is this?
You aren't sure!
But that would mean some of our own boys will get hurt, Mister President.
Yes, sir.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
I hope not.  Now, as soon as you do what I told you, have Plan-R radioed to the Wing.
And lastly, all privately owned radios are to be immediately impounded.  They can be used to issue instructions to saboteurs. Air Police will have lists of all owners.
Yes, sir.  General, can I ask a question?
Perhaps, Major.  Perhaps.  Pour me a scotch and soda, please.  And help yourself to whatever you like.
We've come a long way since World War II, Major.  And the lessons we've learned are all in Plan-R.
How much soda, sir.
Perfect.  Thank you, Major.  And now let's drink a toast.
Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Major, I hate to say this, but I think you've been enemy indoctrinated, and you don't even know it.
Then there's no chance for recall?
But we can't communicate with the base.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
War.
War?
Check.
We'll worry about that later.  Okay, I'll take damage reports.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Hang on, boys.
Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam!  Lothar!
Seond safety.
I bit his jugular vein.  Now will you shut up and get up here???
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
Forget it.  Okay, team, let's break it up and get ready for the kick-off.
Are you sure?
Maybe the warning system's out.
I tried everything.  Something must have gotten bent or twisted from the pounding we took.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Would it matter if they hit at a flat angle? I mean, do you think the deuterium mass might separate from the atomic trigger?
But they couldn't come out for a hundred years!
"Burger Manifesto, Part One" is gonna make people think?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
It was pretty bad, huh?
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
You didn't get me in trouble.
Yeah, when's he coming?
Oh.
Yeah.
You know what? He probably gets bored with all that shit.
I'd get bored.
No, I'm not saying that I wouldn't love it.
Okay.
So, we're all old friends of Pony's. We go way back to our childhood.
I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
I know, man.
No. It didn't, Buff.
Look.
She's dead.
Tim...
Bullshit.
That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
Guess not.
You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Yeah.
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
Buff is funny. God.
Yeah?
Yup. Hey, um, so, um, listen, man, I got to go show the tape to Danny at the hotel, and if I get the gig, Erica is gonna teach me how to surf in L.A.
I will.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: "Either the salt is rotten or the meat."
I could.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Oh, man. Wow. I was never into football, you know?
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
He is.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Oh, yeah, it was a great show.  You guys missed it.
Two-fifty? They go up?
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Ask your girlfriend.
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
What?
Well, I, you know, I took her to the van, you know. It was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? And she started crying, "Tim, Tim, what's the matter? I love you. Don't go!" And I was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and I was filled with disgust, man. And I fuckin'... Oh, man, I really...
I hit her.
Good, good. I, I hope he does.
Come on. You don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and Mohammed had a nice laugh?
Why, why did you start this in the first place, man? They never hurt you.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer what?
I hate that.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Yes.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
What? What do you stand for?
I stand for honesty! I stand for some level of truth!
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
Typical male.
Sooze.
And?
So what do you wanna do?
New ground?
Mm-hm.
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Shit, Jeff!
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Yeah, shit. Naw, man, you know. It's hard work, you know?
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Yeah, they could be songs.
Of course it does.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Look; okay, come on. Look, what are you doing? Look, that's enough. My wife called the police. They're coming.
No, this has everything to do with you.
Oh, yeah?
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
I can't believe you're still here.
No, I'm going.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Really? What else does your mother say?
Where do you get your ideas?
Well, I mean, she always answers her beeper.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Come on, Jeff.
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
Look, it's really not my fault.
Well, use your head, "Stalker Betty."
Wayne Gretzky.
It's off... I can't take the fighting, the back-stabbing, the open hostility. We're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Huh-ha-wha?  Ahh!  I'm under the ice!  I'm uh -- oh...man...  That was a weird one.
Look, I might be moody.  I might be gassy.  But I am perfectly sane.  Think about it.  In school, they tell us, "Dreams can come true."  Right?
Yeah.
I'll just ask the question myself... "Is Jack Bartlett interested in me?"
I'm sorry, Diane, but I'm not gonna watch my dreams fade away 'cause the Virgin Mary here thinks she's gonna get ideas from kiddie movies --
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Or that!  Look, you guys, I just want to provide a future for my baby.  I know my bank branch like the back of my puffy little hand.  I could open that safe in my sleep!
Hold on...
I'll get them before "Touched by an Angel," don't worry.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
Now how the hell can I help you?
My best friend got pregnant.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
In a deep freeze.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
What for? To recover that knife you stuck in my back?
I had a teacher like that once.
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
You did?
What about all those ideas you had?
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in.
I gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
Second generation, huh?
I just don't.
No.
Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
Lots of people were.  Lindbergh had just landed in Paris.  Come on in.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
It is not.  Get out.
I'm sorry, and I'm sorry you lost your friend, and I don't think red is the right color.
I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
Or teach it a better tune.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
Fair enough.
I will not have it butchered.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Thank you.
I'll take care of that.
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
Not now, my dear.  I'm playing three no trump.
Come on!
Careful, it's slippery.  I had it waxed.
Just follow me.
What's that?
Great stars have great pride.
I know that trick! He wants to belittle me.  He's trying to get my price down.  I've waited twenty years for this call.  Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
Thank you, darling.
Good night.
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it.
All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house?
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Yes, I am, Norma.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
And I'd take it in a second, Norma -- only it's a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in Dayton, Ohio.
You can't do this!  Max!  Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
Oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
I don't know, sir.  Madame made the arrangements.
And she's turned you into a servant.
That's right.
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
There's nothing, Gillis.  Not even if you were a relative.
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
Yes, Madame.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
But what will happen?
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
No problem. She can have it. I hate mountains.
It's for your own protection.
I'm taking you to the hospital.
I have to.
That woman who's after me. She hates you. Because she knows I love you.
We have to have a long talk about all this.
Where Superman's from? Krypton?
We're from different worlds.
You're not afraid are you?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
If we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. Come on. You can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
Miss what?
Well, there's several ways to go .
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
I'm ready for her. I'll show you.
Why George, are you proposing?
He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Yes.
I'd rather not talk about it.
It was just a trim.
You sure?
Somebody's gotta do something!!
What? Me?
You need me, Selena. I'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
You Scorpios can never take a joke.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
I was just thinking, if I had your skin problems, I'd use a good tannisroot ointment. Every night.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
Nonsense.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
Yes, I see it. Shining like a jewel.
I was on Earth...
I know.
Help me to get back to Earth. Where my friends are. They need me.
Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
Zaltar!
Mr. Roebush?
Brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
The kid will do fine on his own.  Give it your best shot, Ricky!
Clark.
I didn't --
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
You thought that?
Clark, I think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
No, thanks.
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Call me.
Lana, I'm from Metropolis. I see Superman every day.
Me too. That's why I put this one up.
Look, I don't know, Kent. . . CLARK  Personally, I think it could be a terrific story!
What kind?
They don't actually lose 'em. You can't lose what you never got.
So where is all them half-centses?
One.  And a half.
Uh . . . no, man. I got some work to finish up here.
Say what?
What?
I did. isn't it neat-o?
What are you talking about, fella?
That's what I been thinkin' about. How you been keepin' me.  I ain't getting' nothing outta this gig.
Huh?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
What will it do?
Stone mutha.
Ain't nobody gonna mess with my machine! I'll...I'll... what will I do?  I'll build in a counter-punch! Anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! And wiped out!
Yeah, sure.  Ain't nobody gonna stomp my electric train...
We gonna crash?
Sister! I'm his sister!
Anytime.
And this is...  ...Clark.  My friend is around here somewhere, I'll just look for...
Well...I guess they did get a little carried away.
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Whoopee.
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
You've got to pick three more numbers.
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
What's wrong?
So all we've got to do is pick up the garbage.  We just have to find our where in Heaven Krypton used to be. Then good old Gus here contacts the Vulcan satellite--
Not quite. What is that in the lower right hand corner?
Don't bet on it!
Hostages?
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Maybe I could try --
Be my guest.
Of course, that's what friends are for.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
What??
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Lois, I . . .
I was right. you are Superman.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Oh, hi.
What else could I do?
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
Don't you watch television? Don't you listen to the radio?
There is some good in you, Lex, after all.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
Why am I doing this? Why am I here?
It's beautiful.
I think he said a "curl."
Isn't that what the old Canaveral guys used to call a comet on an East-West trajectory?
No possibility for parole?
I asked the right question.
We will bring him to his knees!
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
Luthor, you poisonous snake . . .
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's talk a deal, Superman. We can take a lunch on this --
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
Don't worry. I won't make you do it alone. I know all the right places. I'm a member at all the right clubs . . . We'll start tonight at the grand opening of the Metro Club! It's a date!
Come early. The view is so romantic from my balcony.
But they're expecting us. It wouldn't be polite.
You know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. Men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
I don't think we're being treated fairly, Lois. And I'm going to tell Miss Warfield.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Daddy . . . ?
Stuff it.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
Forget it, Princess. Clark is the world's oldest boy scout  Trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and I don't remember the rest, but he's them too. And I promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
An angle?
Something . . . wonderful.
. . . I look at you, Lenny, and I know how the Romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
Lucky I brought my drums.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
What? A genius? . . . an inspiration?
Luthor, I suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
You'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
A mind is a terrible thing to waste, Lex Luthor. And you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. I'm taking you in.
Bunkers!
You and Lois, you get all the action.  There she is, out in the wild West and everything.
I know son, I know...
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Thanks, Clark, but I'm booked for the night.
It's not what you think. Darn it. I'm going out on a story. The Secretary of Defense is landing at the airport tonight and this kid's going to be there to make sure he answers a few questions he'd rather duck.
I'd better get you down.
Stay and listen!  Besides, it's twelve in the afternoon. This is no time to go to bed.
You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
We just take it?
But if I put my leg out like Claudette Clobert in  --
There was a recipe on the back  --
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
Then -
Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
Who? Clark? I never cared two hoots for that fella.  Jonathan Jr. That's got a ring to it.
Yes, true. But on other worlds there would be other problems - heat, cold, no life, no life support systems...No, Lara, believe me; Earth is the least of evils. On Earth, his lighter gravity will render him almost weightless - that can't be helped. But with his denser molecular structure, he will also be strong.  He will be fast, He will be virtually invulnerable.
If I do, you can punish  me. Fly me to Bermuda and just lave me there for two weeks.  This is fantastic! I wish Clark were here.
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
I'll always be grateful, Mr. Luthor.
Otis...
Cleaning a rock, Otis?  Jot it down. As soon as we're back, he feeds the pets.
In a way  -- oh, it'll be a relief. I'm a wreck. No rest for the wicked, y'know. It wasn't enough, the radio frequencies, then I had to worry about getting to the missile and adjusting the aiming. So that if I could have activated the launch  -- well, Lex Luthor would've hit the spot.  There's a little place on Route 190. Dead on the practice optimum stress point of the San Andreas Fault. It wouldn't mean much to you, Superman, but I call it...target zero.  Pancho's Taco Palace...
Ally.  That's right.
And what does he do again?
Then...when did she get better?
Not unless you can raise the dead.
Oh.  Right.
Goodnight, Nicole.
Well, Sam, I might as well tell you the truth.  It's this lawsuit you've gotten yourself all involved with. I want you to drop the damned thing.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Billy, that's too early.
That's because he misses you.
Sure.
Well I don't.
And what's that?
What's that, Dolores?
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
I didn't say that.
We've only got honey.
Nicole?
No.  Not mean.  Just...very angry.
Will you be spending more than a night?
At school.  She fell for Kyle just before we graduated.  Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
There's the Prescots...
What do they do?
No.
How old is she?
Here we go.
Yes.
Of...course I do.  I just thought...I could get you another
If you could pick the shrimp off, as well as anything that touches the shrimp...
Who are you?
Yes.
Listen to me, Mrs Otto.  Listen very carefully.  I do know what's best.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
Yes.
This is before the accident, Nicole. Do you understand what I'm asking?
Dolores was driving too fast.
Seventy-two miles an hour?  You're sure of this?
I told you I was positive.  The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
There wasn't time?
It's okay.
As opposed to this T.V.?
No.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
Great.
Okay.
I don't know.
Someplace where no one knows her.  Someplace strange and new.
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
It's compensation, Leo, for the marginal life we lead.  Sidney, did you hear the story about the cloak-and-suitor who -- ?
Thanks, I see him...
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
I doubt that it matters any more.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
If it were that easy, you wouldn't find an empty phone booth for the next two hours...
Hurry back.
You've been very kind about it, Mr. Hunsecker. HUNSECKER Give Susie credit for that.  I took her word that there was nothing to the smear.  Matter of fact, I'll have my say about smears on the show today.  That's why I'd like YOUR personal assurance, too.
Son, lots of people tell me I'm a gifted man, but I still can't see around corners.
Incidentally, what happened to that doll? - You gave me the item last night.  Still alive?
Can I come in for a minute?
Yes, with your clients' names attached.  That's the only reason those poor slobs pay you - to see their names in my column all over the world!  Now, as I make it out, you're doing ME a favor!
I'll listen one more minute.
When?
How?
And who's feet is she on now?
Integrity - acute, like indigestion.
...And he's got them on him.  I appreciate a thing like that - I appreciate where you are looking out for the virtue of the city.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
And where was his wife?
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
But...
I hate to see you like this --
Nothing...
According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
You tell him, I stutter!
Well, for one thing, he thinks J.J. is some kind of monster.
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
Well, maybe I was wrong, too... But there's no doubt, Susie, that we have to face some serious things...
But you didn't do much about it, Susie.  You walked out, and there I was...solo...and not too good at that.
That's right!  There's no way I'm going to finish the new processor now.  Forget it.  I'm out of it.  I'm quitting Cyberdyne tomorrow... I'll sell real estate, I don't care,,,
Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
They have it in a vault at Cyberdyne...  It's gotta be from the other one like you.
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Right.
No, no, no.  You gotta listen to the way people talk.  See, you don't say like "Affirmative" or some shit like that.  You say... no problemo.
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
I couldn't... oh, God.  You... came here... to stop me?
Ready.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
And what it that?
So do you.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
No.  There is another chip.
On Furtwängler.
For Chrissakes I hate that shit, cut it out.
Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies?
With more what? More what?
Your mother, too.
That... that was a different matter, I... I was tricked.
'Happy birthday, dear Adolf, love Wilhelm.' Or words to that effect. That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'Okay, Adolf, you win. You're the number one man. Have a swell party.'
I'll tell you why. You remember we talked about you playing for Hitler's birthday?  And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Exactly.  Replaces the baton, gives Steve the case.
Oh, I see, he made you co-operate. And now are you a communist again?
Of course. You, too. Like everyone else in this goddamn country.
Son-of-a-gun. We'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.
Never heard of him, who is he?
Also a conductor. Very brilliant. Young. Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan'. Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army. The same thing happened to another critic. True or not, it's not such a bad idea. Critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the Russian front.  But if you really want to get Furtwängler, ask him about Herbert von Karajan.
Yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as K.
Thanks, Chuck.  I need the money.  Can I still work the hours around my classes?
Just what you see, pal.
I hate the beige one.
Aha!  Is she young?
I'm here to help you.  Reese, Sergeant/Tech-Com, DN38416...
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
I volunteered.
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
John gave me a message for you.  Made me memorize it. 'Sarah"...this is the message... 'Sarah, thank you.  For your courage through the dark years. I can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as Fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  You must survive, or I will never exist.'  That's all.
You like it?  It's my first.
I'm wrong here.  I wasn't meant to see this...
I want to buy you a hot dog so bad,Kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  You're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
No.  Never.
Ticklish?
SKYNET.  A computer defense system built for SAC-NORAD by Cyber Dynamics.  A modified Series 4800.
Most official records were lost in the war.  The computer knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.  Her name. Where she lived, just the city. No scanner pictures.  The Terminator was just being systematic.
Go ahead.  You're safe.  There're thirty cops in this building.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
I just called.
The stock will turn.
Remember Daniel Grant?  Do they say, "without Daniel Grant, there is no Baer/Grant Publishing?"  He's gone sailing, Alan.  He's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
No.  This is my lawyer, Samuel Sutherland.  I thought you two should meet.
I'll be right with you.
It was an accident.
Home.
"... wait for help."  Wait for help. I'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
You pull me up.
It's not like anyone could actually open it.
They'll love that.
You're a grown man.  I'm not responsible for you.
Hm?  Oh, yes.
The maitre d' called you Christine.
Keep it.
Can we talk?
Come here...
No cops.  I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud.  They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
Whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  Your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  You ruined people's lives.
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
Where'd you get that gun?
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
That's my fault.  I get too worked up at these.  I'm very method.  You do know... that's not my name.
One brother, one sister.
Single?
Boyfriend?
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
They'll be wanting it back.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
You've heard of it.  You've seen other people having it.  They're an entertainment service, but more than that.
Why would you say that?
What's this all about, Connie?
Shhhhhhh.  Wait... wait...
Who?
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
Do you know how to change a tire?
You're part of it...
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Stop this.  It's not true...
Yes.
And, they didn't take that watch?
I know, look at me, well...  What happened?  I don't know.  I don't even really know.  I have some things to try to take care of... I need the car a little while.
What's all this for?
How do I find them?  Their offices are empty.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
Shut up.  Cuff him to the rail.
They were my husband's.  My late husband... may he rest in peace.
Have we met?
The key?
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
Did you worry about him?
Nobody worried about your father.
Look, where is he?!
I know who she is.  Take a message.
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
Sounds like they make tennis rackets. What do we know?
It's not Victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was Victorian.  This is gothic, this is English Craftsman, this is Romanesque.  This is... insane.  Who lives here?
Well, I... uh...
Who's Watts?
I did okay.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
You don't really believe it's haunted... Do you believe in ghosts?
We can't stay here looking for her.  She doesn't want to be found...
Nell.  You will come here now.
My mother used to hum this to me. Like her mother hummed it to her. And my great grandmother Carolyn hummed it to her.
This is where we're going?
I'll take her with me to the University tomorrow.  I can't believe I read the test wrong.  I didn't see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
Oh!  You scared me.
Yes.
This?  It's from a thrift shop.
It's all I could afford.
Yes.  I've missed it.
You, too.  Happy tossing and turning.
Two sets.  I don't know.  Maybe they're not even his.
Maybe he never came in.  If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  Maybe he's outside.
Before he painted your name over Mister Crain.
Just think about one thing right now: What color?
Me too.  Although I learned one thing about you, that you don't know about yourself.  You can be a pretty decent bitch.
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
It's not a compliment.
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
It must've been a time.  A golden moment.
We think?
See, a successful man like me has limitations -- I lose touch at a street level.  So I have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split.  Maybe he was Gordon's <u>pusher</u>.
Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
You're in gun country now, my friend.
Where abouts?
Did Jenny know?
Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing <u>them</u>.  Checking <u>them</u> out.  I felt like she was covering <u>my</u> ass that day.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Has he?
You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads.
Well, those are the breaks.
When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean.
Ashamed.
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Well, I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me.  Some sort of pop music producer, wasn't it.
What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All].
Depends, don' it.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
You ever been to London?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
I can well believe it.  I'm sure he has done, son.  He's about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
Yeah, I guess you are.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
So what's your beef, pal?
Of the deal, man.
No kidding.
No rest for the wicked.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Five thousand.
The L.A.P.D.
What d'you mean, any happier?
Like what.
Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong.
While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
What are you doing here?
That's right, your life is Shit, and I'm to blame.  It's that simple.
Ann--
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
But more or less.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Well? How'd she do?
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
I'm, uh, I'm--the barber.
Uh-huh.
Look, uh... Creighton...
OK. Take your coat, Ann?
All right, I guess.
But it's...
Who?
So?
*That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!*
I knew we'd pay for it.
...I don't think so.
...He told them to look at me--look at me close. That the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that I wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that I was the barber, for Christ's sake...
So, who should I--
I'm fine. Thanks.
I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Uh-huh.
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
What the hell are you talking about?
...Nah.
Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
My *wife*?
Birdy...
Yeah?
Could you come with me please?
Not an owner.
Crane? We have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
It's too late now.  Guests are arriving.  The Mayor's car is pulling up.
Yes.
I understand.  But Mr. Cuthbert, we've got bigger problems.  Depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
Where's the walk-in safe?
What's the combination?
I'll do it.  Just let me find my portable phone.
In every exhibition room.  The museum's divided into five cells. The reception and exhibit are in cell five.  We could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
Where the hell are you?
What's left of it.
Mind if I have a look?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
If you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
We haven't got time.  You have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
Everybody.  Get behind me.
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
The virus itself might have positive applications.  They'll keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  Greg isn't joining us?
There's a dead body in the exhibit! People are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
What's that doing here?
I'd say we're in its home.
Oh yes!  Who could forget.  Afterwards you sent me that amazing case of Chateau Lafitte.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
Read it out loud.
Not really.  Just the sub-basement.
Nothing.  I'm in third grade.  What's a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
Not that big.
Not yet.  Let's try the fork to the left.
Keep the light up.  I can't see.
He's right.  Follow me.
How does it work?
What happened?
No one knows.  The Kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
I don't understand.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
Where did you see it?
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
It didn't want the fibers.  What does that mean?
I do have a fabulous rate on a cruise ship departing for Fiji tomorrow.  But you wouldn't want to do that.
That's right.
What music?
Do it!
--and certainly the first time that an intruder has been rewarded with a starring role.  I really must congratulate you on writing Kirk back in.  A master stroke.
Amnesia.
Of course.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
I prefer to think of it as a mirror.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
And the show now generates a yearly income equivalent to the gross national product of a small country.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
You think she'd go through with it?
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
Right now?  We've got finals tomorrow.
Outta my job, outta Seahaven, off this island...<i>out!</i>
Who?
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
How about them?
I've got to show you something.
What exactly?
Not the whole thing, Truman.  You were right about one thing.
Gee, that's great.
I won't be late.
Oh, God.
I know.
What do I do?
I don't know--
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?
You hate gambling.
I think I'd like a little company.
--What the hell are you talking about?!
You're part of this, aren't you?!
I feel certain my condition runs in the family.  Can't this wait, dear?
It was Dad, I swear, dressed like a homeless man.  And you know what else was really strange?  A businessman and a woman with a little dog appeared from nowhere and forced him onto a bus.
When you get to Fiji?
Who?
Good.  Good.
I'd ask for identification.
When was that?
Into what?
You got some kind of business with him?
Selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
Do you?
Not according to the men in blue.
What is it? Kiddie porn again? Sexual battery of a patient? I've had my license taken away in three states.
What happened to playing a hunch?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
I just did. You're buying.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
Mulder -- what are you doing?
Mulder -- I can't -- I'm already way past the point of common sense here --
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
How was it contracted?
The bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
No.  It didn't show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
Yeah, well they may this one.
What do you mean by haul?  What are you not telling me here?
Very weird.
Run.
General McAddie's.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
About what?
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
He's come and gone.
No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
What do you mean, walked?
The only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. Your father arranged for your sister's abduction. He allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. As a clone.  He had different hopes for you. That you would uncover the truth about the Project. That you would stop it. That you would fight the future.
I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Where is he?
What about you?
The geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. About our place in their Colonization.
Well, without a cure for the virus, we're nothing more than digestives anyway.
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
I'd be there for him.
Okay.
What happened?
Thanks Miriam.  Say hi to Henry and...
Sometimes... Once they've been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  They have so much they want to tell. But they've never had a sympathetic ear. They need someone to understand why.  Stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  It was part of the ritual. Some weren't found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  But these last three... They were still in water - always in water - but  Listen, he wasn't just careless.  It went beyond that...
I did, yeah.
What happened to Charles Gish?
He brought you to me, didn't he?  If you want Julia to live, trust me.  Trust him.
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
Yep.  Eloped.
I don't know.  I think it does.  You know, Catherine... If you ever want to talk about it.  What happened to Stargher.  That last time.
's broken.
Mocky-Lock.
I need you to find something in the basement...
Already there.
No.
Awaiting his arrival.
She remembers because it was her "dream truck."  Wanted one just like it.
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
That's not what I'm talking about, Pete. I'm talking about waking up and realizing this girl's gonna die.
Considering where I've been...
Thank you. I enjoyed the play very much.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
Dr. Winkel? Who is he?
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
Tell you what?
Well, I didn't learn that from him.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
Holly.
I don't know.
From Kurtz. They have just been arrested. But Harry won't come, he's not a fool.
Keep the packet.
What can I tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
I was a friend of Harry Lime.
Fellow called Lime.
Could you buy me one. I haven't got any Austrian kroners. Thanks.
September '39.
Once in a while.
I can't say that I have.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
No.
It's more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
I'm not asking you to.
I was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Do you know his number?
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
You've got plenty of contacts.
Zwei zwartze.
Vinkel.
English?
Who?
Yes, sir.
Now, hold on.
What else?
Here.
One or two kilometers.
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
I think we're about half way.
Big?
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
You can swim?
Sshh. Etienne will be angry if I wake him. He thinks I waste film taking photographs of the sky.
One night I will get the perfect photograph.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
So on one you are rich, on another poor. On one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Read <i>Mein Kampf</i>? Hitler had all his best ideas in prison.
Abstraction. They're obsessed with abstraction.
What's he care about?
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Oh, really?
Bigger and better.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
You can't.
What do you care?
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
I'm good at languages.
Why not?
Fuck that.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff...  Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again.
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
Danny, what about the Jews?
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
It's slander. It's reckless disregard. I'll sue you and your fucking Jew paper.
To hear them read Torah.
I can't help what I think.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
A forty-five.
There's a bomb here. It's going to go off at seven-thirty.
No!
Yes!
I was going to ask you the same thing.
So what Jew would you kill first?
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Nobody ever beat me up.  Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know.
Number ten.
The mother.
Mrs. Moebius.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I can tell....
Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us?
None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
But your man isn't quite a God!
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
The Italian, I presume?
No.
Have you known him long?
Little.  Very little.  And skinny, very skinny too.  That is compared to me.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
You know what I'm talking about.
I won't, I swear.
Why?
What does that mean?
He's training.
... What's your name again?
What room have you got?
People say that?
Not at all!
Then, it's very chic.  Avanti!
Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Everything about what?
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
Thank you.
We can't dive anymore.  They want to cancel the competition for a while.
Tea... or whiskey?
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
I didn't dive.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
I saw how it has to be.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Anything.
Promise you won't forget me.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Johana... New York.
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
Why is he doing this?
You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen?
Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen.
No way, it's too dangerous. Besides, my days of hooking are over.
From the story of Purim.  Well, now that we're all acquainted, let's sit down and start the Sabbath.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Oh. Okay.
Kiss me you Semitic stud!
I forgive you.
Mordechai!
Mordechai!
Mom, stop with this already. Of course I love you. You're my mother.
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Oh yeah. Take a look.
In fact, he's just informed me that he personally plans on cancelling Christmas this year.
That's some cold shit.
What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes.
If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
I don't know.
Up at the museum.
Yes, I was drunk, Mr. Manning.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Go on -
Tomorrow -
At four. He will be there at four.
What, senorita?
I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too  when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret  a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
Of course. It's the way any decent man would feel in your position.
No. I'm quite sure.
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
It's better you don't know.
Look, Kicks, have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Almost three years, isn't it? And have I ever done anything to hurt you?
Yeah.
And not a sign of the leopard?
Absolutely sure.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
What... What are you talking about?
Excuse me?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Why dont you ask when I left the Mondrian?
Youre repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it womans intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
How... When did you...
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon hung himself...
...You-you spoke to him?
Leon could still have hung himself.
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. Hed never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child suppliers being tailed?
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But its never that complicated really.
I didnt intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that youd been back.  That wed argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldnt help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Im sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
Europe...  France. Im French but I live in London...  ... England.
Well, Id sooner mug an old lady...
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Italian? The Mafia...?
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think Ill get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, itll be too late.
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
I saw the ad at Georges.  Im passing through town and Im in a hurry.
What...?
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
Good.
Yes. But my boss reckons youd still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? Itd cost you about £100 but he said itd be worth it.  Of course, youd need a partner to register. But thats a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
La what?
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelquun récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe its there with...
Check with your sons bank. Banks dont usually give out information about their customers.
Then why arent you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
No. And before you ask, no, hes not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
When... Im told he came here...
My rates...
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
I dont know what your problem is, but...
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
Youre making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guys not one of Friedmans...
An Austrian.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
You thought wrong. I havent seen Leon for months.
Did Leon tell you why he didnt want the police involved, Rhian?
Im afraid I dont understand.
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leons story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
Er... Yes...
Fine...
No...
Los Angeles?
Is that where lawyers toil for an industry that turns serial killers into heroes who give thrills to young women who write erotic novels about psychopaths and rapists?  You go to your world, Ill stay in mine. So long, Mister.
Alors quoi?
Three...
Glucks dead, you sonofabitch!
I think youd rather not know what I think.
Thats the beauty. An anonymous call. Makes you wonder how many people know what youre up to, eh, French-fuck?
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasnt easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, whats your business with these Spitzes?
What do you think?
I dont know. Could be the sound of jewellery hitting a parquet floor, huh?
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Very generous of you all.  How much?
10,000 gold crowns.
I thought you were an archer?
Jeanne, calm down.  You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
Because there's an arrow in your leg.
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
To marry you.
To be killed in battle?
That's an order!
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Yes...
To avoid killing anyone.
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
Am I... am I dead?
The English??
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
How old are you?
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Last night.
Praying.
Many things...
No... I want to be confessed.
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
You really think she's been sent... by God?
I assure you, Charles, the Maiden has no greater admirer than myself. But whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  For the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to Compiegne...
Then her faith will have to be bigger.
I'm... I'm not the king...
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
... You look wonderful...
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Fine -- go now if you want, but not with me!  You may have a duty to God but I have a duty to my people, and my people are starving!  So right now I'm going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to Orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
Not yet.
I... submit to Our Lord.
But will you also submit to the decision of the Church?
No...!
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Oh?  Perhaps someone pushed you then?
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
I said, kneel!
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why would they?
God asked you to do something?
Oh no?  How about this one?
No, no, you did fine.  I'd even say well done.  Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
I agree...
No...
Yes, it is.
Him?
And what does he say to you?
Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
Wladek, please.
I didn't want to come, I didn't want to see all this, but I couldn't stop myself.
I'm sorry - I was given this address. I'm looking for a Mr--  -- a Mr Dzikiewicz.
He'll be back before curfew.
He'll be here soon.
Doesn't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? Where will we get them?
I'll be fine.
Here.
Where do you want me to go?  Look at me. No, no, I'm not leaving. Can't I take my chances here?
It costs.
Who told you?
But why me? I thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. Look at my father, look at us, I mean...
The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
That's better than yesterday.
You don't know, believe me. They bribe the guards. The guards turn a blind eye. They're bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, French cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they don't give a damn.
Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
I can look after myself!
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
'If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh? If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
You're amazing, Jehuda.
Fine, we're fine, thank you, and you?
You're a dirty pig!
Takes one to know one! Pig!
If you need help...
You made contact?
Out of Warsaw. Where?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
We're getting out.
Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
No, not words.
What are they?
She says, throw the piano overboard.
Do I know any gigs?
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
Maybe I could help ya if ya told me his name.
You got a bag or somethin?
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
He was a tear-off rat.  He got what he deserved.  No sense helpin' pay his bills.
I'm busy, Floyd.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Which one?
Mottola.
They workin' for anybody?
Good lad.
I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
Does J.J. know how to use this thing?
I can talk, can't I?
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
Lonnegan after you, too?
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
I never played for winos.
If I can find a mob that'll risk it. But no matter what happens, I don't want you comin' back to me halfway through and sayin' it's not enough... cause it's all you got.
He'll show.
Then why'd ya move outa your room?
You just won't learn, will ya. Hell, you come in here, I teach you stuff maybe five guys in this world know, stuff most grifters couldn't do even if they knew it, and all you wanna do is run down a bullet.  You're just like all them new jerks. Lotsa nerve and no brains.  And ten years from now when me and the others are through and you dumb guys are all dead there won't be one gee left who knows the Big Con was anything more than a way to make a livin'.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Luther always told me to bite my toenails when I get nervous.  You see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.
Seems worthwhile, doesn't it? Maybe it's just for the cave-in on Lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.
That's why he won't know it.
If we're lucky, this'll bring him back stronger than ever.
Yeh, I think so.  I gave the kay- ducer a C-note.  You find out the deck?
Too many people coulda seen ya go in her room.  She was a professional. Used to work in the Dutch Schultz gang.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
But what about all these other people?
We'll get 'em!  Give us a chance. I'm not the only agent in here, ya know.  We go around advertising ourselves, how many counterfeiters do you think we'd catch, huh?  You think I'm wearin' this rag here 'cause I like it?  Christ, everybody thinks life's a holiday or somethin' when you got a badge.  I been here since three this morning, Charlie, and I never knew there was so much ugliness in people.  You try to help 'em and they spit on you.  I shoulda let ya go and gotten yourself arrested for passin' false notes.
Cause I'm tired of bein' his nigger.  I want you to help me break him.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
It's foolproof.  We got a partner downtown runs the central office of the Western Union.  Race results from all over the country come in there and go right across his desk on their way to the bookies.  All he does in hold them up a couple minutes until he can call us and get a bet down on the winner.  Then he releases the results to the bookies and we clean up on a race that's already been run.  It can't miss, unless the Western Union Dicks get onto it.
No.
I could come up with 750 grand in a day if I had a reason to.
Sexogerarian, eh?  Yes.  Yes.  But I can't put that in the paper.
Why did that man want to kill him?
You better take a drink.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
And don't ever try to see me again.
Oh, here she is.
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Disappeared!
tried him once -
Did she make any sound?  Didn't scream?
You see how much we have to say.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
He's all right.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
Yes.  I might not have been shot.
Who's is it?
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it.  Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him.  They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal.  So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
They're all O.K.  Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Extraordinarily lucky.
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he?  How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
Well....
I see.
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Tell 'em.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
That's all I did, Lieutenant. That's the God's truth.  Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.  All right.  Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
I didn't mean you, Mister.
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
You've said that for weeks.
All right.  All right.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
You're going to return every cent of it!
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  And I'm looking after them.
No word at all?
How do you do?  What did you say?....  He is?.... Where is he?  Very well.  He's back in town....  Wynant.  Thank heaven.  He's waiting for me now.  Forgive me, Mrs. Charles...  but I've been so upset.  It's no joke working for a man like that.  I must be off.  Goodbye....  Goodbye,
Well, don't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
Take it easy.
Room service, please -
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
That's not true.  He never came near my tabloids.  That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Macaulay.
Yes.
Did I give it to you?
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
Maybe I will.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
It was his body that was buried there.
Yes!
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
You worked here?
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi.  Mrs. Jorgensen -  Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Home?
Help, I'm being held prisoner in a puzzle box factory.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps.  There is a war going on!
He's not so--
Should have blown already.  Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up.  Doesn't hurt to have a look out either.
Ready when you are.
We started this together, and we're staying together, so there's no point in splitting things up now.
I told you:  When I straighten someone out they stay straightened.  This is how it works:  Nobody touches the gold. Except when we're on the move and someone's carrying it, nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it. Agreed?
That's what he says.  He could be a spy, or something.
I out rank you, that's why.
What if I do?
Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
So you can give us away?
I told you, I'm shooting Iraqis.
I did it!  I got the box open.
Cool it, Jaeger.  Hey, Wes?  Wes?
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Wh-what do you think--
You can't tell anybody about this.
Mine.
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
We're not going to do anything.
They're going to kill us!
So where do we start?
We'll lie.
They'll search the pack.
I don't want it this way.  I wouldn't kill you just to kill you, but I can't let you lose the gold for me.  Not when we're so close.
You still got a map on you?
What?  Yeah.
Makes two of us.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
You know what I'm going to do?  I'm just going to take a second.  I want to look at the gold.
Yeah, I guess we should.
And then shoot them.
Shoot them!
What?
We'll make up some kind of lie.  They won't find the gold.
He's going to slow down.
Okay.
Oh yeah.  Accidently.
That's in two days.
You ever think about dying?
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
Yeah, well, we're not.
Anytime you want to do something about it just let--
I know you're a pussy.  I know that.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
I've got a new agenda now, it's get rich. The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all.
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water.  And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
You actually got around to killing someone.  I'm impressed.  I guess you're only half a bitch.
Birth born....UMMM...Sexact.
Permant cortex bond.
No, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. Secure another sinex drop.
No, Tetanty.
You've seen enough.
Don't be so sure.
Look,dirt!
Looks like food.
No....I though  I'm afraid.
I don't know.
I've got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I'll never make it the way I am now.
Don't let them separate us.
No one can see us now we're alone.
We're leaving.
I don't feel well.
When?.....How?
I was lost.
No, I...
What have you done, Cut your hand?
All the insides are gone!
No?
Save yourself....
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
You should know better than that!
Damn.
Just do it.
Don't push it, slick.
Sounds like terrorist heaven.
`Til we get a better lead.
Your partner?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Nothing.
Make up your mind, trigger.
When in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
We work fast enough for you?
Thank you.
Time for bed, kiddos. Say goodnight.
I don't know...
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
You don't fish.
Huh?
Goddamit, Reilly--
Yes, sir.
My God, you're going to use her, aren't you?
We'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
Yes.
And diamonds in the front.
Very well, Jacques.
in doorway. He bows, returns into office; door shuts.
Well, he knocked at the door. You see, I was expecting two--uh--two business associates.
No.
I thought so.
Insignificant ... He's a secretary, always <u>was</u> a secretary, always <u>will</u> be.
Doc--!
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
And, waiter--you see that moon?
I don't want to see you at all!
Um-hum ...
Are <u>you</u> insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
But not now.
What do you mean?
M'sieu Monescu!
No--no.
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Gaston Monescu.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
Two fifty-three, five--
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Ah!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Certainly!
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Five, seven, and nine--
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
<u>Also</u>, <u>um</u> <u>zwoelf</u> <u>Uhr</u>.
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Well--I am Madame Colet.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
Right!
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
No--yours, madame.
You would?
I know all your tricks.
So you think you can get me?
Any minute I want!
I know it.
Yes, Gaston?
And you expect me to believe that?
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police?  I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!" 
Yes--uh--
What is it, madame?
Right!
How much is your salary?
Ever had a romance with a crook?
Because I hate him--because I love you!
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
That's right.
Don't you mean work me?
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
She knows.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
Can I bum a cigarette?
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
No! It's our lives now, not theirs. And I'm in charge of this boat! Now row!!
Excuse me.
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
No.
You're crazy.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
Yes, exactly!
If only it were that simple.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
No, no! Just with her hands.
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Jack, I --
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
To the stars.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
I'll be right back.
Never let go.
Mmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller.
That's enough.
What past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  See the date?
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
Your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. And that name is the only card we have to play.
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
Isn't that interesting?
What did you want a gun for?
Yes--are you?
You've got lipstick all over you.
Good-by!
There's soft music--
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
Don't let's talk about it.
What?--
A dollar forty.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Now you're talkin'!
Partners, ain't we?
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella--  Here's that twenty-five hundred. 
Oh, yes. On the pier.
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
Good night!
What'll I say?
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
June? That's my wife's name.
Well. I'd rather see <U>you</U> get it than the company.
Knots!
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
Never mind.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
I don't get the humor of that remark.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
Eh?... Oh.
The country boy's about due.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
You leave the kid alone.
--you'd go with him!
Of course not--  --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
I'll explain later--
Let me look at it.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Then why did you run away?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Oh, so that's it...
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
Well now that's a little more Like it.
Good.  That's real good.
Crack me back of the head like Some stinkin' bull.  Hell, you Ain't no fightin' man, you're Just a cop.
Make you a deal.  My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone.  Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans.  You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
Ain't our way.  We go all on one, One on all.  Fight one of us, you Fight us all.  That's the Cowboy way.
We're gonna get along just fine.
Well... 'bye.
No...
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition.  Forever.  I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life.  That is if you don't Mind.  Jesus.  Good day now.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
In pace requiescat.
All right, lunger.  Have at it.
Bless you, darling  Darling!  Are you mad?  You're not Wearing a bustle.  How lewd!
Not exactly...
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
Perfect, Wyatt.  Simply perfect.
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
But who was the Devil?
I stand corrected.  Wyatt.  You're An oak.
You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Sorry, sorry...
Revenge?  For what?
No.
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Never even heard of anything like it.
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot.  I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Wyatt...
Wait!
Milt Joyce, owner-operator.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
Really?  You sure?
'Least you admit it.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
We'll see about that.
So he can tell the story.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
What're you talkin' about?
Isn't true.  I can't see a damn thing.
Sure...
Hit a streak when we left.  Him And Kate.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Bundle up, Virge.  Cold out there.
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
What do they say in Russia, General Bukharin? 
We'll see about that.
Come. Let's get out of the noise.  - I'll give you a tour of the building, then we'll talk.
I see.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.'  ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond?
What about the gold?
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
Four o'clock. M will meet you in the conference room.
Not all of us, 007.
I don't care who you dial, so long as it's not me. Next -
Just hold me.
Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Fishing?
Not from forty feet.
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
Hey - the world is my office.
I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur.
Thanks.  Take care -
Let's not make it a habit.
Think about mom.
Trust me.
Are you listening to me?
Don't say it.
And when might that be?
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Remind me.
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
Thank you, Uncle Elliot.
Don't worry. Mr. Bond will get the message. So will his boss.
No. I have a better idea. In fact, Mr. Bond may have actually improved my original plan.  Bring them both to Hong Kong. And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve.
I don't know. He's not in the database -
That's a lie.
Junior spends time with his child.
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
This is what it is all about, trying to keep from being out on the street.
I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the roof, you would have rebuilt the whole damn house.
That is a damn lie and you know it. Every time father asks you to do something, you either half-ass do it or run off and hide. Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her, with your smart ass self, that you weren't a farmer; get Junior to do it. Every time someone asks you to do something, you always say, tell Junior to do it. Boy, you ought to grow up.
We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
What is it, noontime?
It was nip and tuck.
He will be alright.
What for?
I always had chickens, ducks and whatnots.
I don't know how two brothers can be so different.
How is the garden doing?
It's only a tale.
My feet have never been on anything that wasn't directly attached to the ground.
Everything these days is made overseas.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
You're suppose to teach your children what you know. Junior, I don't have to worry about. Babe Brother is a different story.
Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Wasn't Hocker lynched?
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
My mother passed on years ago.
All the people working with us are really doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering.
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
Country people got so many strange ways,
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Counting the what? What does that have to do with the price of butter?
You know the man next door is near death.
Oh, yeah!
Just one?
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
Right here in the van.
Alright, everyone.  You're clear to come up.
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
Oh, yeah, tough guy?!
Buzz, I would love to see you try.  'Course I'd love to see you as a crater.
This is the perfect time to panic! I'm lost, Andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Shhh!
Whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger.
I can't do it!  Take care of Andy for me!
Plus is positive, minus is negative! Oh, let me!
Oh no, Hannah!
NO-O-O... Don't touch her!  NO!
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
A lunchbox...?!
Alright!  That's it!
Nothing.
Oh, how ya doin', Rex?
This is it!  This is it!  Quiet, quiet, quiet!
That's right.  Your toys.
Right here, Woody!
No, Slink --
We're gonna get outta here, Buzz -- Buzz?
I knew you'd come back, Woody!
Slink!  Hang on!
Didn't you know he made things?
Nothing is left but us.
You're late for breakfast.
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
No, of course not.  She's one of the top students at her school.
It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
Arnie, this is crazy.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
I can't do that.
So my wife is lying?
Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world. Canada is completely overwhelmed.
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
She asked me not to.
Barbara --
No, not yet.
What do you think?
How long's the job?
You can't make me.
Oh, yes I can.
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
In school?
Yeah.
I get A's.  All A's.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
Arizona.
No --
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the USA.  Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search.  The odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds.  We hire drivers with nothing to lose.  Then we throw a lot of product at the problem.  Some get stopped.  Enough get through.  It's not difficult.
Yes, sir!
I don't know, sir.
But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
Oh, really.  General Salazar was there?
I feel like a traitor.
An informant.
But will he be house-trained?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
Which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?
Noriega is a criminal.
I need to find my daughter.  I'll pay you.
I don't know what to say.
I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Yes, I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year.  But, you must understand that it is very difficult because of corruption in the police force.  We get a tip that he is one place, then we get there and he is already gone, having been warned by someone on our side.
I'm sorry... Did I wake you?
If we're moving the press conference, we need to do it now.  Are you all right?
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
It's three a.m.  I'm not supposed to be here.  I snuck out --
Well, I've not brought them.
I guess you would, Franco.
Diane.
Great.
Jesus.
And that's what's illegal. Do you know what they do to people like me inside? They'd cut my balls off and flush them down the fucking toilet.
Is that a promise, then?
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
He forgot. Useless motherfucker.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Oh, really?
Do you recall the school motto?
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
Spud, they're my sheets.
No. Me Neither.
Have you got any gear on you?
Now remember --
Would not say no, would not say no.
One hundred and sixteen minutes.
Screenwriter?
Eh - Ian Fleming?
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
When are you going to visit him?
And I'll tell you why. Because I'm fed up to my back teeth with losers, no-hopers, draftpacks, schemies, junkies and the like. I'm getting on with life. What are you doing?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
It was just an idea.
About four kilos. So he tells me. Got drunk in a pub down by the docks last week, where he met two Russian sailors. They're fucking carrying the stuff. For sale there and then, like. So he wakes up the next morning, realizes what he's done and get very fucking nervous. Wants rid of this. {---------- He's looking for Swanney to punt it, but Swanney's nowhere to be seen since he lost his leg. ---------- }
I'm going to get it right this time. Going to get it set up and get off it for good.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
Excellent.
Your usual table, sir?
As you wish.
The strategy is this: get clean, get mobile, get into dealing, and this time next year I'll be watching the rising sun with a posse of oriental buttocks parked on my coupon.
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
Are you serious?
Mr. Murphy, {leaving your friend aside,} do you see yourself as having any weaknesses?
It could. Yes.
New course? You have no authority.  What's going on here?
Other ships, yes. But no experienced commanders. Captain, I need Jim Kirk.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
Have the Klingons responded?
Understood. Kirk out.
I hope it won't come to that, Mr. Scott.
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Transporter room. Status.
Because it's there.
An eternity during which we'll be vulnerable to Klingon attack. Korrd-you tell him.
Let me do something.
I ordered you to defend this ship.
I was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. For that, I'm sorry.
How do you know?
This, er, person... didn't by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
I am here, Captain.
Sybok, listen to me. In order for this craft to enter the landing bay, Enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. To get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
No special conditions?
Kirk to Enterprise. Listen carefully...



Uhura, I had the strangest dream. I dreamt that a madman had taken over the Enterprise.
I know you better than that.
I don't get it.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
I want to go to his place.
Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
No, nyet, negatory, not on your tintype, no way.
He's still looking for that old file... can't you just appropriate it?
Meanwhile, he might find it.
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
No... Tron ... must... destroy MCP... first...
Wrote the...?
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
A little ...  Over there, the Mountains of Data... and I think that's the Silicon Valley...
Lousy utility companies ... they're the same wherever you go.
How 'bout yourself?
Oh, uh...I don't remember too much...
Touche, honey. Yeah, I've been doing a little hacking here. Which I've got every reason, as you well know...
You're getting out of the business?
I can't. There's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds!
It's something Users do.
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
I'm shocked.
Where are you off to young lady?
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
You'd tell me if there was something wrong, wouldn't you, pumpkin?
Fine.
Why?  So I can wind up like you? What's the point?
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
So what makes you think that the slack I cut him in any way translates to you?!
Why?
For Dana, schmuck.  Bring your kid something.  You know.  The dad thing.
Yep.  Sleep fast.
Albert Gibson.  Three four nine nine one.
In her dreams.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Gonna try to get a closer shot of				* Beavis & Butthead.							*
Can we go to the office now, Mr. Superspy?
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
The purse is still at the house.
You tell on me, I tell on you.
You didn't have sexual relations with him?
In her Walkman.  It's the one thing I knew she'd be taking.
No!  Never!
And you still reach for your piece every time.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
Yes, sir.
Very good.  It's sixth century B.C.  Do you like the period?
And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
Yes what?
What'd you do, honey?
Oh, sure.  Fine.  I'll get some more gravy.
I don't know anything about a faction.  I just met Simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  I barely know him.
No.
Well, maybe a little.
You wouldn't believe me.
God, you have great legs.
Absolutely.
Helen?  It's Simon.  Is it safe to talk?
Sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  See-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* Marriot...
Nope.
You can't have just one.
How come?
Oh, hush up.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
The oriental.
Thanks a lot.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
Sure. Why not?
'Bout twelve.
I love to get pie after a movie.
What do you want to know?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
So he really loved her?
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
Who?
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Will you be my wife?
Thank you.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
What?
Heard that.
You wanna get unhaunted?
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
She's with me.
It's great to hear from you.
Get the fuck outta here!
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day.
For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
I know.
Tell me.
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Elliot.
Elliot what?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
He trusts you?
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
I really don't know.
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this -  - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
What are you talkin' about?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Sure was.
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
You do.
He knows something's up.
Pussy love pink rocks.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Read my lips.
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
Where's that?
Then where the hell do you get off talkin' that kind of talk?
I DON'T WANT YOUR "WOMEN," YOU BRAINLESS TWIT! I WANT TO BE WELL!
And your only goal is...???
I'm going to be completely honest.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I can't make the police let you go...but I do want to help you.  And I want you to trust me.  Can you do that, James?  May I call you "James"?
It's so clean.  No germs.
No.  That's the reason they chose me -- I remember things.
Wait!  This is only 1989!  I'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995.  It's not the right number yet.  That's the problem.  Damn!  How can I contact them?
No more drugs.  Please...
1989.  Six years for you.  There's the sign!  Right here!
It's the next step.  I checked out the Baltimore information, it was nothing. It's Philadelphia, that's where they are, the ones who killed everyone.  Zs that a radio?  Does it play music?
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
Something bad.  Is that all the music? I don't want to hear this stuff...
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
I said I was too young to drive.  I didn't say I was stupid.
I'm..."mentally divergent".  I would love to believe that.
Give me the gun.
You mean, treat me?  Cure me?  Kathryn, those words on the wall -- I've seen them before...  I...I...dreamed them.
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
Flowers!  What flowers?
I mean in my dream -- I didn't realize it was you.  Then...I woke up and I...I thought you were gone.
I need to make a telephone call.
What are you talking about???
A lawsuit?  You going to sue them?
You do know me.  You helped me once.
I just need to have access to the pure virus, that's all!  For the future!
Bulishit!  You're fucking with my head!
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
It's about obeying, about doing what you're told.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
No, thank you.
Yeah, yeah.
He no!
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
Maybe one day I'll get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
More or less.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
Nope.  Darrell.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Yep.
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
How much?
I don't know, but it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
I don't have a credit card.  They took my wallet.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
Please, just leave the car alone.
It is morning.
Genuine Draft?
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
Baby didn't die.  Just froze off all it's finger and toes.  Just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  But the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  Now she died.
John . . .
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
You haven't even looked at them once.
Yes, I have.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things.
All over.  Chicago, Miami, Detroit. Just lately Albuquerque.
Where you headed?
What happens if you lose?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
What do you do anyway?
From my father.  He was the tribe's Shaman.
It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
Games?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
Take me with you.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
How much money has he got?
Lied?  What do you mean?
I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
I thought you couldn't leave.  I thought you couldn't get your car.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
Funny thing.
Give him the money.
You heard me.  Count it out.
You killed him!
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
You killed a man for no reason!
But you said we could be together.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
Grace!
I think I busted my leg.
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
What do you say, Jake?  Should we trust her?  No?  I didn't think so.
I swear to you that's all that happened.  I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
Accident.
I hope so.  Listen, Mr. McKenna, about your wife:  If I had known she was married--
Wait a second--
How do you know if you've never tried?
I do all right.  Real estate isn't a bad game such as it is around here. The trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  You can turn a few dollars that way.
I do.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
How do you put a price on murder?
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
Is the job done?
Drop it, Jake.
You could say.  I don't even have it yet.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
Wh . . . what are you talking about?
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
For what?
I hate to bust your bubble, but I wasn't defending you.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
What the hell are you talking about?
Will you shut up!
That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Stand up.
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Sure, Sheriff.
Soda.  You got any soda?
But, Senor--
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Christ!
See.  Ain't nothing I can do but keep him here beside me.  That's where he belongs anyways.  Me and Jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and Jesse we been pals since the war when I lost my eyes.  He was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...I miss him.  I'll see ya later, unless I come across something worse.
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
You afraid of the dark?
Stand up.
My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie?
I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know.
Darrell's a moron.
Live there?
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
I do.
You're talking like a madman.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe.
...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
Cause she's dead.
I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you.
What the hell are you talking about?
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Yeah, I can fix it.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.  And be careful with her, will you?
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
To replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
You believe that?
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
Two-hundred.
What?
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
Darrell.
Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys?
Eh?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
Drove into Superior?  What for?
I didn't say it bothered me.
Did you like it; me watching you?
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
The same thing you do.
What?
Like you.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
You'd never understand.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Because I know you're full of shit.
I could if I had Jake's money.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
I don't know about that?
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Bobby? Are you all right?
Grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. It should reach down here. Go get it, throw it down.
...Now, let me get this straight. Two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. Now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here.
What kind?
What was that all about?
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  Now, I'm not going to axe you again, Mister.  What were you doing with my girl?
I am Russian, da! I am also <u>rich</u> Russian, da? Maybe we work something out, my friend Sheriff?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Telling when people have done something wrong?
The car accident you were in... Was there anyone else involved?
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
Why'd you do that?
What things?
What if he wasn't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him?
I lied.
In the passenger car?
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
Whippin' ain't a little thing, Alice.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
Just wondered. Anybody could be scared.
Me? No. No, I guess not.
WW Beauchamp... Little Bill Daggett and... "friends."
Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
All week?
Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
Didn't scare Little Bill though, did it?
I could of... easy.
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
What for?
What happened, did you hit him?
Yeah.
First one what?
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
We done stuff before for money, Ned.
Well, I guess they got it comin'...  But you wouldn't go if Claudia was alive.
Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm...  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
Nobody liked me... none of the boys. They was scared of me... figured I might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
How far kin you see?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Yeah?
I seen him.
Easy, Bill.
Shit, Ned, this ain't the time to quit.
Supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
More.
Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
Maybe.
I can't spot 'em myself but you could. That red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, I bet.
I've been looking all over for you. You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor?
Time for what, Edie? Time to look into me a little more, that's what. No matter how well you cover my tracks now, they'll find out who I am.
No. It's never going to stop, period. It won't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us. It's finished. I'm finished.
They'll never stop.
The word I got is you hung up your spurs, man. What's that all  about?
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
You okay?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Fenster and Hockney?
No killing?
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
This I had to see myself.
Mr. Soze made a few calls, yes. You were not to be released until I came to see you. It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney, Ms. Finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. Holding the rest of you became a moot point.
A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis.
Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Where?
Kobayashi.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
I just want to hear your story.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
The D.A. gave me immunity.
Came from Redfoot.
Right.
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why didn't you help him?
I said I never heard of him.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
You know what it's like, Agent Kujan, to know you'll never be good? Not good like you. You got good all fucked around. I mean a stand up guy. I grew up knowing I was never going to be good at anything 'cause I was a cripple. Shit, I wasn't
You think he's..?
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
You're joking.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Abrams...
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
Four cases in three years ...
Neither does he.  That's where he loses.  This man's scared to death to go to court.  We only have to call his bluff.
How did you settle on the amount?
What is the truth?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
They want to settle.    It means a lot of money.
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
She THREW UP IN HER MASK.  Let's cut the bullshit.  Say it:  She THREW UP IN HER MASK.
And what did your team do...
Well, we...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Your Honor...!  Your Honor...
`Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.'  Yes.
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
Yes.
I...yes.
... that's all right.
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
You guys, you guys, you're all the same.  The Doctors at the hospital, you...it's 'What I'm going to do for you'; but you screw up it's `We did the best that we could. I'm dreadfully sorry...'  And people like me live with your mistakes the rest of our lives.
I understand.    I went to the Bar Association.  They tell me you're going to be disbarred.
Why is that?
...she went in complaining of stomach cramps.  Good doctor would have doubted the information on the chart.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
It was good of you to meet...
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
There's nothing they can do to me.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
You're going to settle out of court?
Her doctors killed her.
Do you know who her doctors were?
Okay.  I'll meet you here.  Tuesday night ... I gotta go.  You going my way?
No.
Then why aren't you testifying for their side?
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Ready, your Honor.
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Pardon?
And what are you?  A cop?
Yes.  It was, actually.
A brick house says you divorced him.  I'll put you on your honor. Bet you a hundred dollars against you join me for dinner.  And I'll take your word for it.  Now you tell me the truth.  Because you cannot lie to me.  What's your name?
They might.  Yes.  That's the point ...is that they might...you see, the jury wants to believe.  They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe.  I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case.   I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve.  And every one of them it's written on their face, `This is a sham.  There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe...maybe...'
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Maybe I'll tell you later.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
What would you like it to be to me...?  I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Stop pressuring me...
What are you going to do?
I have to talk to you.
... hey, I don't need your charity ...
Come on.  Let's get a drink.
I know what I said but not now. You won it.  Franky.  You won it. When they give you the money, that means that you won.  We don't want to go to court -- is this getting to you...?  You know who the attorney is for the Archdiocese, Eddie Concannon.
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Mary Rooney.  She won't talk to me.  I tried her at the hospital. I'm going to try her back at home. Read this.
They still have to take it to a jury.
Gimme the address.  I'm gonna go. We're going to need her.
And all we've got is a witch doctor!
She's protecting the Doctors she'd be up there on the stand...
The 'History'...?
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
... I know.  I went ...
Are we going to win?    We have, you know, other tactics, though...
I just saw her.
Hi.  How are you doing?
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
I did.
A single hour.
Yeah.
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
He won't talk.
Almost a year.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits.  Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business.  What's on your mind, Gavin?
Well?
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
Why did she never tell her daughter?
Do you live here in the hotel?
Judy Barton.
But you haven't lived here long.
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Tomorrow morning.
Don't go.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
Ah, no!
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
Wherever you'd like...
How does it work?
To complete my cure.
No!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
At...
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Wandering about.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
Wander about.
No... it's wrong.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
No! No, thank you!
We have.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
I don't like them.
No.
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
No!
I'm here, I've got you...
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Oh, yes!
Carlotta Valdes?
No... she only comes to sit. Two or three times a week. And I never ask questions, you know. As long as they're well behaved. I must say that I've wondered --
In her room? Well, yes, of course if you ask. But it does seem silly...
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Who?
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Yeah.
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Naturally.
By whom?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out. 
You're an asshole.
She's dead.
Don't point at me.
You have acquaintances - business friends and superficial golf buddies. You have always been a fringe player. You have some serious male on male intimacy problems.
You go home!
You can't keep bringing up Starbucks. That was your only real hit in like 75 tries.
What do you think you are doing?
What about the blood?
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
Oh I did? I think it was your little rat fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker's head.
Don't talk to me about character.
What?
That's right.
She's in the bathroom...she's still working.
Sweet deal.
What is her disposition?
I'm calling the police.
He is not cracking up.
What is the question you asked me?
I don't know...
You got a nasty side to your thought process.
Hear what?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
My what?
You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation?
You have a King fantasy.
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
You said nobody would miss her.
Ball park sausages.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
Goosed!
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Photographer?
Hotel for my parents, the tent, the band, the Judge...
How could I know what else I forgot?
I'm working my ass off here. I've taken care of absolutely everything Keith.
Don't you dare.
What are you talking about?
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
You go down there.
Honey I don't have the time...
Of course.
I'm working on it, I've made three calls.  I can't stop thinking about how much I love you.
Yeah. Nesting.
The chairs.
Well, can you come back inside?
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
Don't even.
Micheal, by accident.
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
The only proof is those bodies.
I just want her to be happy.
So?
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
Downstairs in the closet.
I'm saying it's luck. All luck. You work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. Where does the ball bounce? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. He's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot - "Pup Corn."
Where?
I want a black one. A little black brother. That's a big problem it seems to me. Lack of racial integration. That's a big one. You think?
What song?
Give them to Refugio.
Are there many windows?
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Don't you ever see him?
No, it isn't that, I can assure you. I wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. I've proved that to myself. On the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I'd be alarmed.
It's up to you entirely. Don't leave, then ...
You must listen to me before you go.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
Fifteen yards.
And in the vegetable plot?
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
But why? Why?
Quiet, my dove. Quiet, or I'll ...
One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
Why?
Is she coming back?
Don Jaime loved to watch me skip.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device  it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Yes or no, Mr. Barnes?
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
He was a computer program for crissake.
I'm getting by.
Fine  you want to stay here?
Their weapons missing?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Not from in here.
Don't remind me.
Of the six prison inmates you've tested  all of whom have had at least some military or survival training - only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
You've had a yearandahalf to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer.  ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
I haven't been working on anything.
Should I have?
All my work is my finest.
Glad to...
In other words, par for the course.  How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday?
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
It was just like before, wasn't it? Wasn't it?  But you are making progress. Instead of killing seven people to get the one you're after, this time there was only one other person involved.
Every music school in the country rejected him and he turned to computers.  Stay here.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
I am impressed.
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak with most miraculous organ.
Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming.
This is my area of expertise.
Enjoying yourself?
I was wrong.  And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid. I should have told you. I won't make the same mistake again.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
My guess is dead.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
GRIMES, YOU'RE DEAD!
You really are pathetic, you know that? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. He is nothing compared to me.
Why's that?
...on the way in.
It's the White House.
We've just found out They Have the Bomb.  We've Just Found Out They Have The <u>Bomb</u>, aaaand... No, No wait a second, no, no, wait a second, No.  The Bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> Bomb.  Ooookay.  It's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in Canada!  Eh?  Albanian Terrorists have placed a suitcase Bomb in Canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the USA.
...where?
What are you talking about?
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
He's <u>dead</u>.  He's <u>dead</u>.  The Fella Killed Old Shoe. 
Well.  Alright.  What is it?  What's, he, uh...?  He had an Illegal Immigrant, was his Gardener, some years back...?  What's the thing?  You people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
Well, yeah.  Now.  That's not good.  <u>Okay</u>:  <u>Okay</u>.  We'll set up the War Room <u>Here</u>...
It won't hold.
....we landing?
Tell me again.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
What did they find out about the Gulf War?  One shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>Legos</u>.
...they sound what?
What did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  You see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 Bomber.
Here's what you got to do:  Get your Press Office, Right now.  To deny;  There <u>is</u> no report of Albanian Activity.  They have to deny it. Now, get the C.I.A.
...take a long view.
Anything at the Airport?
Get on this, right now...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
Due in Nashville.
Yep.  Well, we started it, he Ended it...
I know who you are, Mr. Ames.
THE GROUP WATCHING TELEVISION.
Where's my pill...?
From whence did it come?  Our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  Of Armed and Violent Dissidents...
Yeah, I need a list, people in Military Special Pro...
N'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
What <u>are</u> you interested in? 
Why do people go to war?
...you the Press Office?
Why Albania?
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Because.
They got to have something that we want.
Well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  We're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
The war ain't over til I <u>say</u> it's over.  This is <u>my</u> picture.  You think you're in a <u>spot</u>?  You think this is a tight spot?  Try making the Hunchback of Notre Dame when your three lead actors <u>die</u>, two weeks from the end of Principal Photography.  This is... this is... this is just...  Act One:  THE WAR. Act <u>Two</u> ... the... uh...
Yeah...?
What's the thing with Morse Code...
Hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...
The Albanian Campaign.
They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the <u>Wheat</u>. Variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
Speaking of that...  We're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
How's our friend?
He's doped to the <u>Gills</u> ...
Get on the phone, have'em fly in a ...whaddaya need to be a citizen?  A Judge?  Whaddaya need?  A Judge...? Call in a <u>Judge</u>, call in a Federal <u>Judge</u>, and...  If you're concerned about him, being an ..."immigrant." Make him a <u>citizen</u>... Eh?  <u>Guys</u> ... what's all this <u>mopery</u>, we...
Prouder of this, than anything I ever did in my life. I want to thank you, Ron.  Want to thank you.
Let's take the bridge from <u>nine</u>, and the intro from <u>one</u>, and...
It can't be a ribbon cause AIDS had a ribbon, cause the Yellow Ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
Jim Belushi...?
Surest thing you know.
Why a beret?
"...the special detachment..." Good!  What is it?
...for the beans, yes...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
I'll grow old. We'll both die. And we'll never have known each other. That's sad. At least one drink for a dreamer...What's your favorite drink?
Sounds tempting. I prefer mine with a twist of fate. You know like us meeting. Don't go away...
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
Somebody has to pay for that error. And it's not me.
Howard the Jerk reneged on me. I've got to cover his loss to the tune of about seven grand! I'm tapped out man, American Express got a hit man looking for me.
Hey Marv, he demanded confidentiality...
Didn't I tell you to knock before you came in here?
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Ah, I had a tough day. Some jerk D.K'd me and I gotta cover his loss.
Coulda been a contender.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
How's Mom?
Damn right, it gets us out from under suspension. We'll get those new routes to Pittsburgh and Boston and the equipment we need. We're gonna compete with the big boys now.
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me?
...And you're even lovelier than I pictured. I brought a birthday present for Mr. Gekko.
What if he asks where I got the money?
We are?
Wherever you like, Lutece, 21, the River Cafe...or maybe we can just drive around for a while.  Work up an appetite.
Like? Uh...hmmm. Well...
What about you, I hear you guys are handling the Fairchild Foods merger and it may not be going through. Any surprises I haven't read about in the Wall Street Journal?
Sure Roger, whatever you want, it's cool.
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
Follow him? Mr. Gekko I...  It's not what I do. I could lose my license. If the SEC found out, I could go to jail. It's inside information, isn't it?
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
How much is enough Gordon?
...I can't make it tonight.
Dump it.
Destiny took us apart, but I knew it would bring us back together.
You could have a great beach house for that.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
I'm kidding, I'm kidding, we're still young, Darien. So what's money anyway when everybody's making it, it's all relative. After all, this is not the house in Connecticut, this is just a crash pad good for a couple of years...before we slip our two lovely kids, Yuppie and Fruppie into the Lycee Francaise.
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
...just kickin' ass and taking names, Mr. Mannheim.
Can't blame me for trying. You look as beautiful as that painting I just bought.
If you mean what you say, I think we're in the ball park. I'll take it to my people.
He did?
Businessman!
What's that?
It's eleven forty-five let's go
And your coff - excuse me, caffeine sir
Hello, Mrs. Webster.  Is China there?
Safety in numbers man.
This. is killer.
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Sell my soul?
Servants.  Oh isn't it terrible darling, two more people have disappeared
It's only two hours away.
Of course you will.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
Then we both are.
Then why did you?
Because he was worried about me.
You think that'll help?
Maybe.  I don't know.  I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive.  Like somebody needed me.  And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
I am.
Toward the end.  You remember?
Who's that?
I've seen you.  From the window.
Is everything alright?
Very much.
Um...sure.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that.  But I was so touched by your concern.  I've been lonely here.  Perhaps we could be friends.
I'm not.  We...we met at a party.
You must have been very proud.
Of course.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Absolutely.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Then what was it?
Please.
I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
It's Saturday.
Not the focus.
After that.
Of him I think.
To make sure she's all right.
That's not what I'm sug--
But what if something happens?
I do, I do.  I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
What?
Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
...like it never even happened...
I never said I wasn't upset.  Of course I'm upset.  I miss her terribly.  But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Norman, this isn't about you.  This is something that's happening to me.  It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention.  Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Call ya later.
...Please stop...
Claire...
What?
Do you know it?
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
:No, I said, I hate what I'm doing to Darcy. Oh, boy, men are stupider, it's true.
NO!  she's pregnant, Aaron.  she's got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   don't you think I know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  Listening to my heart, aren't you...?  The Timex still ticking...?
"Go back, Michael.  Do what you can..."
Nothing was ever more false.
Then you wear it.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
Giff - shuttup.    you're mother was a sweet child, Rowan... A lost little girl in a world too full at things
I'm not saying I believe it...but I heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   They made a deal with the devil.  Y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  And some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
Hell - Julien believed it... Carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
Better than most, I suppose.
Put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
Stop it!
You - are - a - murderer.
But I had to use my hands.  None before you could kill with their mind.  Graham, my dear.  Your uncle...?
The door, Michael.  find the key...
FAST.
I'll tell OR we're bringing -
You bastard...
No, my love.  I want nothing more of the dead.  I want you to --- chang me.
You went into the cells --- and you changed them.  How...?!
I'll destroy you.  I swear it!  If you don't kill me, I'll find a -
I know.    you are my son -
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
All I meant was -
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
They need doctors in New Orleans too.   Michael - think what I could do with the money!
Hello..
Their what...?
So how come I love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
That's cause we're below sea level.
Where are you gitting these...?  Aaron --- if it's a boy.
Yyou look terrible.  You're exhausted. You practically live at the goddamn clinic.    Even pregnant women who aren't doctors know that You can't -
Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Gotcha.
I can't leave now.  Don't ask me to explain!  I just can't!
That's a wasp.  Fuckers'll sting a tree if they're bored-  so - where is she...?
I like him.  He can stay.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Is that what you were doing...?
Papers...?
Standard for a Mayfair marriage.  Rowan - there is a codicil concerning the Mayfair assets. They must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... Michael  that is it's in the will - for centuries.  Tradition enjoins, Rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
Don't give me shit - what do you want?
As long as you get the HACKSAW piece done by FRIDAY... FRIDAY?
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
The touch?
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
I have something I have to show you...
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
then why did you marry her -
You've killed but you're not a killer
Nothing could be better...
Is LESLIE here?
Don't worry about it -
You and your pep talks.
And some really fast cars.
And while you're at it, I'll take ten dozen of those puppies with the springy heads.
Ladies first.  I insist.
Makes your shoulders look so big and broad.
I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible.
I always wanted Craftsman tools. He even got me the limited edition Buckeye colors.
But that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.
It's my private business! Mine!
They didn't want me when I was born. Why should I care...
Well, why should I?
I guess we could go to Disneyland or something.
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
What do you mean? I'm Ted Nelson.
Hmmm?
Whatever you want.
Hang in there, I'll think of something.
But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust.
We'll send you the release forms, Ted. Our staffers will help in any way they can.
You mean they knew who I was?
Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.
Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.
My new bike.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Look Ted. I'm cool with everything. You've long been dissatisfied with our mediocre little town. You've always had an itch for the good life. I'm happy for you. This couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
I have absolutely no intention--
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
I'm trying to help.
I don't get the distinction.
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
Write what you want. Just try not to make it so obvious that you're crazy about me.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
You're so twitterpated you don't even see the miner's hat and the pickax.
Second only to unbridled, narcissistic conceit.
He didn't. He had it built.
He phoned it in.
I see.
That's two words. And I'm out of the "exposed" business, remember? I need to graduate. Besides, Merk's a boy scout.
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
You better.
I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town!
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
But how would we pay our bills?
Me? The King of Coitus?
I was like a different person tonight.
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
My parents always say hard work builds character.
It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything.
I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
I'm just a messenger.
Kelly.
What if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
He used to come around here.  He had a thing going with one of the girls over at the Glades.
Suzie.  Then you're not her grandmother...
Take your time.
He was large?
Not at first.  He was still inside but he wasn't moving or anything...  He said we had this secret.  And that now he'd be able to help me... because we were close... Something like that.  I don't know.  It's hard to remember, exactly.
I'd like that.
There's a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  There's phones there.  I cruised the place, but I didn't see her. I figured she was probably there but that she was angry and didn't want to be found.  I don't know... Maybe I should have called.  But it's not like Kelly can't take care of herself.  I figured we'd just take it up on Monday, in the office.
Maybe she used another name.
Unless what?
Her father didn't leave her squat.  The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
What if I'm right, Gloria?  What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?  What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
Where's this coming from?
What about witnesses?
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
Get off this Ray, now.  If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide.  You get an ID, you call me.
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
Ms. Toller.  I'm asking you now, under oath, did Samuel Lonbardo rape you?
I'm sorry?
What?
Yeah, sometimes.  Lots of the kids hang out here.  You really think something bad happened to Suzie?
Nothing.
No thanks to you.
No you don't.
Deal.  You know, I just looked out front.  My ride wasn't there.  You suppose you could give me one?
About six and a half million dollars.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
God, I've been calling you.
But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
Say you love me.
I just want my life back...
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Shut up.
That's right.  That was his name.
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
The one you bought at school.
Like I said, I hadn't really expected to use it.  Anyway, I'm going through a drawer.  I hear a car.  I look out the window.  I see Nicole driving away.  I leave my room, and there's Kelly.
Well, shit, you're the cop, they don't teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  You weren't supposed to kill her for Christ's sake.
Put Kelly on too.
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
Are you mad at me?
That was the same thing Ray said.
Trust me, the guy's dirty.  He'll like it.  Especially the part about offing me.  Now get out of here.  Go make yourself a new friend.
Didn't you see her this morning?
Your train?  Listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... I've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
You need that real often?
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Aha?
Yes.  Starting with a screw.  Now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with Western desperadoes to fully appreciate what I'm doing here, but...
You're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
All what?
You go ahead.  I'll stick with Loveless.
It is?
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
My disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  I spent three years on the stage, you know.  Remind me sometime to regale you with my Lear.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, I see, an easy plan!
We'll see.
They don't even realize they should be frightened.
Really?
Fine, I'll stop.
Exactly.  Any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  And what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
Nicely said, sir.
Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
He turned that monster into stone!
Good.  How long will it take?
As if you care.  I saved your life, Peck.  Those guys woulda killed us!  You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
You hear trouble.
Yes it does.  The Fairy Queen told me.
You?
I won't.
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
No.
Why not?
Guess I'm not used to so much.
No... I saw the man who killed him.
It's them, Sam.  Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Amish.
What have you got?
Just us.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
No you're not   You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
But why?
But 
Can I have something to drink?
You tell him. When you're able.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
Something wrong with buttons?
Hochmut?
Oh. The bullets.
But... You may not be well enough.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
There was.
Aren't you? After today?
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Say again?
Not yet.
God, Fred...
I know.
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting!  Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Oh, Auntie Em -- it's you!
No --
No, Aunt Em -- this was a real, truly live place.  And I remember that some of it wasn't very nice....
Please, sir.  We've done what you told us. We've brought you the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West.  We melted her.
Yes, sir.  So we'd like you to keep your promise to us, if you please, sir.
Then close your eyes, and tap your heels together three times.
Aw, come, come, come --
Oh --
Do you know any?  Oh, you mean the thing -- Yes, well, I -- I never do anything without consulting my crystal first. Let's....
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Has it poppies on the wall....
Oh, but he will!  He must!  We've come such a long way already. 
Oh, goodness! Did any of them sting you?
Lions and tigers and bears!
In another hour, I'll be King of the Forest. Long Live the King!  If....
I'd like to roar 'em down -- But I think I lost my roarer.
Ohhhh --
Did I scare you?
What?
You stay out of this! I'm here for vengeance! So it was you, was it? You killed her,....
Oh, rubbish!  You have no power here. Be gone, before somebody drops a house on you, too.
I don't know.
Oh, you did it yourself!
What was that?
Yeah. Me?
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
She - she can have my Witch Remover.
Hold still - hold still --
Howdy, Miss Gulch.
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
Quiet!
Emerald City!
It's a whozis?
Oh, dear, dear.
Yes.
Th.D.?
But I still want one.
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
Dont know any doctor jokes.
The soldiers may give you a hard time. Whatever. If we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
Bond --
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
If I dont get to the Boa before he gets to Maidens Tower, M is dead.
So isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
He died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  I intend to finish it for him.
If youve come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I dont need a third...
Always wanted to see the upper lines.
Youre not going to.
I know.
We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
Five more turns and your neck will break.
Just like you...only you were even easier.
Where did you get this?
A rope!
No!  Get me out!
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
Of course...
Yes.  Au revoir...
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Who is she?  Do you know her?
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Because you can't, I know, it's preordained.  So sorry.  I forgot.  Jon.  This, this "script" you're following . . . who writes it?
Adrian -- you've lost it.
You ruthless son of a bitch.  You really believe this mad-scientist bullshit is going to save the world?
Of course, we looked like idiots in those bondage outfits.
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
Play one.  Educate yourself.
Sure.  It works.  I mean, look at this face, Daniel.  I'm thirty-eight years old!
Pick a record.  I feel like dancing.
With any luck, the world'll end before we get ours.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
Don't look.  Turn around.
All right.  Mission accomplished.
I don't want to take 'em out.  Just want to keep 'em interested.
Are you saying that someone would risk starting World War III just to get back at us?  What about all those poor shits with cancer?
SHUT UP, Rorschach.
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
Laurie!  Good to see you.
And how's life with the walking H-bomb?
What is that ungodly smell?
Looks like a diner.
A Fed, I shoulda known. Who else would have this kind of budget? Now you're gonna hit me with the sales pitch.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You're one sick bastard. A sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. I think no matter which way I go I'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. So here's my answer: kiss my ass, Hop-along.
Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too?
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
You're talking about a very expensive risk here.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Kirill, the sniper. Looks like a bookworm, but he had 72 confirmed kills in Chechnya, they called him the "Finger of God". Assassination and weapons.
So cute. He shows up for a battle of wits with a mental butter knife.
Yorgi asked me to.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Go to hell.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Of course it matters. Hey, hold on!
Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that.
I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me.  I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt.
If they launch it, I know how to bring it back.
It's about your next mission. You need to be debriefed.
You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere.
First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest.
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
You wanna see my politics?
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
... until he found tungsten.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
No.  I'm...  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
I'll tell you one thing though.
I'm sorry.  I'm not strong enough.
I wanted to talk to you.
Were you now?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
Gosh, I hope so.
I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
MMmmm.
Of course.
You have your tickets?
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Love me?
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Is it worth taking a chance?
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
Elizabeth!?!  'Can't waits any longer.  Arrive in your arms at ten tonight.' Oh, God!  Not tonight.
A week.  Ten days at most.
Yes, sir.
Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Vermicelli.
I am a scientist...!  not a philosopher.
No, Fred ereck.
Why are you talking like that?
What?
Did you hear that strange music?
What?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
Yes, Master!
That sound good, boss.
I'll bet it's a doozy.
Is everything ready?
MMmmm!  MMmmm!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
We only arrived a few minutes ago.
Oh please -- just till I get sleepy. Then you can force me right back to my room.
All right then, quietly!  Close your robe and stay right behind me. Don't make a sound!
Oh, Frederick... you're not only a great doctor, you're a great... you're almost a...
I say, it wouldn't be fair to you... or to me.
Yes, I will.
MMMMmmmmm!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
Indeedldid, MyLord. Itwas one ofthe first to cross.
My Lord.  This list was prepared for you. I don 't think another can understand its true value.
But will they make good use of them?
ft could be you flatter yourself CoghilL It's that odd eye.
And I assure you, you do not In fact I'd be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?
