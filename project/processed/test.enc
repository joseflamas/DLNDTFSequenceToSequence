Sure have.
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
She okay?
No.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
He was, like, a total babe
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
But she doesn't want to date.
No, but
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
I thought you hated those people.
You got him involved?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Number one.  She hates smokers
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
She kissed me.
Are you lost?
Nope - just came by to chat
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
William didn't even go to high school
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
You don't care if I die
Kat! Wake up!
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
Were you in jail?
Maybe.
Then why'd you ask?
You 're so --
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
Good call.
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
State trooper?
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
So what I want doesn't matter?
Macbeth, right?
I missed you.
Your daughters went to the prom.
He's the devil's child...
You say Asia can be found by sailing west?
If God intended our proximity to Asia, do you believe he would have waited for you to show it to the world?
He is a mercenary!  Did he not already try to convince the King of Portugal of his absurd notions?
It won't be easy to get rid of your prophet now, Don Sanchez.
What a tragedy... what a waste of a life...
I know.
Don Alonso de Bobadilla.
My letters of appointment.
How far from here?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
What do you see?
God... That's in a week!
I'll try to remember that, Marchena...
All of them!  Just lies!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
I have to disagree.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
Do they have such thoughts?
You want a war?  Fine.  We are a thousand.  They outnumber us by ten! Who will you kill?  Which tribe?
In one act of brutality, you have created chaos.  Tribes who were fighting each other are now joining forces against us!  All that because of your criminal savagery!
Well... It's the men, Sir.  They wonder how you know our position. We've lost sight from land days ago...
What do you read?
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
You tell that to them!
Is that the man I knew, Treasurer Sanchez?
... Into a monk...
Then why?
I'm coming with you.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Your mother was blind?
Your father put cigarettes out on you?
I'm abused.  Don't you think?
What about back home?
A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Do you have coffee?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours.
Who do you think, Chief?!
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
What do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
I let her take a shower.
A shower!?  Did you take one, too?
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
Did the D.A. videotape her deposition?
Vodka tonic.
I'm gonna propose.
Where is she?
Only one guys checked in?
Who's there?
Do you have any Czech girls working for you?
No.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Mind if I ride along with you?
This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come.
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Hey.  I'm a professional.
No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead.
I kill someone famous.
We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Is it drug related?
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Alright?
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk.
You promise?
Okay.
Sooner or later that's everybody.
Ready?
You stuff sausage in it.
Are you married?
Come to 45 Broadway.  Don't bring the Police.  Come alone or you'll be in my next film.
No.  I'm the best that's ever threatened you.
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
Is there a problem?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
You said speak Czech!
How you erase this?
The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it.
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
No, I don't get that!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
A job?
As a plumber?!
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
What are you coming here to do?
What was that?
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
What??
What?
What the hell happened?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted.
CONTINUED
Not really. They just said it might be because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that we're being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.
I suppose the idea was specialized training.
I suppose so. Though, of course, there's a more sinister explanation.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Good morning. How's it going?
Yes, it is, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Where is Mrs. Brown?
I was working out what this trip must cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.
Oh, that's such a delightful age.
Clavius Control came on the air just long enough to transmit their refusal.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
Oh, marvellous. It's the first real sleep I've had for the past two days.
Well, I'll tell you why I ask. You see, I've got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial Administrator and I haven't been able to get her on the phone for the past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I'm a little concerned about her.
I see. Well, I'm sorry about that. I wouldn't think there's any cause for alarm.
True.
Our transit time is 257 days. Is that true?
Hal, have pod arms secure the component.
Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I don't give a damn about his girl...
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
I never paid for it in my life.
Maybe that's where I'm gonna cut your throat.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
Where's ganz?
Yeah, I noticed...
I can deliver Ganz.  But you gotta get me outta here first.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
Well?
This part of town, they'll make us for heat the second we walk in. Just back me up like you've got a piece...
What are you talkin' about?
This sucks.  A maniac gets hold of my gun and goes all over the streets killing people with it. So, instead of me being where I oughta be, which is in bed giving my girl the high, hard one, I'm out here doing this shit, roaming around with some overdressed, charcoal-colored loser like you.
Get this. We ain't partners. We ain't brothers. We ain't friends. If Ganz gets away with my money, you're gonna be sorry we ever met.
No class...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
Maybe we should pay Luther a visit.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Notice something funny about that bus?
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
And you're tellin' me you don't want any of this cash?
That's right. Not my style, Reggie..
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Wait a minute, wait a minute... who's this?
Long night, too, from what I heard ... Word's going around that in addition to losing Ganz for the second time, and in addition to Haden busting you back to Patrolman, some jig beat the crap out of you.
Bullshit red tape.
I think I met her.  Now tell us something we don't know, like where they stashed her.
Hey, you're right.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
Bullshit?  I'll tell you about bullshit.  My gun's a real weapon in the hands of a real maniac who knows how to use it.  It isn't my macho bullshit that's killing people, my gun is ...
Promised I'd turn my back while he... ah, never mind...
Stall.
You sure?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Fuck you.  You got no right for this kind of play.
What're you laughing about?
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
I brought the girl remember?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Leeloo's in trouble?
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
What's she doing?
They really made her...
Where's Leeloo?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
...Hi.
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
What mission?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
...Shit!
Which one?
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...Like love...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Been here long?
Actually only one cell survived..
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
Wait or act.
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Yes, Sir!
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
I'm not accusing you...
Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
I know.
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
... What's going on?
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
What are you talking about?
Bullshit.
What the fuck... !
That's five thousand dollars.
Is it?
He might be interested... but it would mean another five thousand.
We can do that.
Excellent.
We do.
Any good?
Starting to recognize a pattern?
I want his name.
Yeah.
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Look, you cocksucker...
Of what sort?
Enlighten me.
Yeah... guess so.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
Okay, let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world where you make four hundred a week in that dump. I'll give you six hundred for a few days.
You've got Penthouse, Playboy, Hustler, etc.  Nobody even considers them pornography anymore.  Then, there's mainstream hardcore.  Triple X.  The difference is penetration. That's hardcore.  That whole industry's up in the valley. Writers, directors, porn stars. They're celebrities, or they think they are.  They pump out 150 videos a week.  A week.  They've even got a porno Academy Awards.  America loves pornography.  Anybody tells you they never use pornography, they're lying.  Somebody's buying those videos.  Somebody's out there spending 900 million dollars a year on phone sex.  Know what else?  It's only gonna get worse.  More and more you'll see perverse hardcore coming into the mainstream, because that's evolution.  Desensitization.  Oh my God, Elvis Presley's wiggling his hips, how offensive!  Nowadays, Mtv's showing girls dancing around in thong bikinis with their asses hanging out.  Know what I mean?  For the porn-addict, big tits aren't big enough after a while.  They have to be the biggest tits ever.  Some porn chicks are putting in breast implants bigger than your head, literally.  Soon, Playboy is gonna be Penthouse, Penthouse'll be Hustler, Hustler'll be hardcore, and hardcore films'll be medical films. People'll be jerking off to women laying around with open wounds. There's nowhere else for it to go.
Child pornography.
I don't know, where are yours?
Yeah, I'm a real genius.  What choices have I got?  Fuck, just because I know about stuff like tonight doesn't mean I deal it.  I work a job.  It beats pumping gas, beats making hamburgers.
You're telling me it doesn't get to you?
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
You hired someone to open it.  I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
Do you want to tell me what you found?
I didn't know what to think.  I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband.  To know that he watched this... this atrocity.  But, I can't go to the police...
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
Will you watch it and see for yourself?
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Hello?
I've been ordered into bed.  The doctor says I've gotten the flu, or some other wretched ailment.
I've made progress.  I'm in Manhattan.  Once a few more pieces fall into place, I'll drive to you and give you an update.
What was she running from?
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
She went to California, to Los Angeles... she wanted to start over. She wanted to be an actress...
You... you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure...
None too discreet, is he?
Yeah, I know the spiel.  If you could bag it, I'll be on my way, thank you.
Kincaid and Joey died last night.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.
How'd you learn so much about dreams?
We have matching luggage.
How long have you been awake?
Not really.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.
He's going after Debbie.  I gotta stop him.
Rick, please.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
T-T-Thanks Alice...
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
So?
It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Yeah.  I guess so... What happened?
In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Hey...wake up.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
Okay, babe.  What's the matter?
Nothing...it's just...I didn't see my father at the ceremony.
There you go.  Love you.
You sure you don't want a ride to work?
You disappointed in me?
I've got to go.
It was no accident.  It was Krueger.  He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  He's found some other way.
It was just an accident.  Like with Dan.
I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you.  But, you're like a locked safe.  You've gotta start dealing with reality.
Krueger is reality.
Not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.
My baby!
Meet me later.  Milkshakes.  Cherry pie. Banana splits.  And no mom!
Naah, I'm done.  Got to be on shift in a couple hours.  Aren't you going in?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
Mark...
It's okay.
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Yes?
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
But if they <u>do</u>?
I wouldn't worry.  So long as we have boats like the Tiger Shark - and people like you, the Skipper, Dave, Kent, Sir Ian and my father -
Huh?
I guess.
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
Dave - !
The frogmen?
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
Obviously.
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Are you alright, Wade?
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Always has been.
Who?
What are you boys up to?
Fine. I'll need a $500 retainer. You can mail it.
Jesus. How much... how much will the whole thing cost?
Hard to say. If we go for custody, depositions, psychiatric evaluations, it could drag on. Ten or twelve thousand dollars. She could win on appeal. If we just want to get the visitation rights redrawn, assuming they're unduly restrictive, it wouldn't be more than twenty-five hundred.
He's on to us!
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Hmm.
Don't mind if I do.
Right. The sonofabitch couldn't get along without me.
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow if you quit him.
You bring him up yourself? That's a steep climb.
The ambulance guys lugged him up.
Twombley sure as hell won't be shooting it again.
Open the door. We're late.
Why do they do that?
Was it funny?
I bet you did lots of bad things.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Are we going in this?
How about a Big Mac?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Tomorrow, Gordon.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Sorry about the long lunch. My clutch is going out again.
Yeah.
I don't want her to go, Lillian.
See. Get your boots.
New hat?  Jill's up, I see.
How's she doing?
I'm sorry about what I said.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Lots of people. Guy like Evan Twombley, Boston union official, probably got lots of people want to see him dead. The Government's been investigating his links with the Mafia.
You knew me as a kid.
It was to the same woman. I was just a kid...  It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
Alright. I'll think about it.
Coffee's perked.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Moving violation! I just got out of bed and you're telling me you're giving me a goddamn speeding ticket? Now? Are you nuts? Is that it, Whitehouse? You're nuts?
Don't ever put your hands on me, Mr. Gordon.
Doing your fucking job. I know. I watch television too.
He's asleep. We were up very late.
What?
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
He was scheduled to testify for a committee investigating organized crime in New England and the construction business.
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
Jill. I was thinking of getting a lawyer. Maybe you can help me.
What happened?
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Then who shot him?
It's too neat. Things ain't that neat. It makes me mad. That somebody can pay to kill somebody, his own father-in-law, and not be punished for it. Don't that piss you off?
I hate to disappoint you, but I don't think it happened.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
He's in a meeting.  He can't be disturbed.
I don't drink coffee.
Oooooh, I'm good.
Alice!
Did we warn them off?
They are in our airspace. We would be within our rights.
Got it.
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
Sluggish... I think it's jammed too.
Walter, if you have a point, make it.
They aren't answering their hails.
The rest of the secret service?
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Get `em ready.  You... come with me.
I miss you. And I miss her.
Look on the bright side, hon. Shep here thinks I'll be a one termer.
What's going on?
Yeah, right.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shut down accelerators.
Te...!
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ted.
Not now, Elaine!
Not now, Elaine.
Simon just ejected!
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Simon.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Negative.
You're sure?
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
I have to see Bud Kruger.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
You can't go in there!
Then Elaine was right.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Well...not for another two hours.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
I love you, Elaine.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
Yes?
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Roger.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
William Harcourt?
What's this?  What's going on?
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Why'd I do what?
Uh, Matthew...
Why?
We?  You've taken it?
George... look me in the eye... George, you don't ever lie to me again.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
We can't let him get away.
You think this is the guy who did it?
We think he could'a been involved, yeah.  You know him?
To be honest, it's hard to say.  I hate to admit it but -- they all still kinda look alike to me.
That where Anderson worked?
Jesus, are the questions too tough for you already?  Let's try again--  Is your name Porter?
Ss'kya'ta'.
Yeah, I heard of it.
The human?
What kind of test?
Put on your wash-and-wear suit and your clip-on tie, have your landlady tie your shoes for you, and show up at the church.  Simple.  Me and Carol are going.
...that's better.  Pan it around a bit.
Which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  One for each person...over a hundred at least.
Yes.  That follows.
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
How long until it blows?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
I heard you were working in the cargo docks.
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Now hold on a second.  I'm not authorizing that action.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
I expected more of you, Ripley. I thought you would be smarter than this.
You wouldn't be going in with the troops.  I can guarantee your safety.
Yes, Hicks?
All right, the area's secured. Let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  First team head for operations. Hudson, see if you can get their CPU on line.  Hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
Outstanding.  Then all we need's a deck of cards.  All right, let's move like we got a purpose.
We gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
Hicks, I'm not going to wind up like those others.  You'll take care of it won't you, it if comes to that?
Fuck you.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Cross my heart.
I'm sorry, Newt.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Yes.  A little girl.
I knew you'd come.
Are we going to sleep now?
That's right.
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish.
Good morning.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
No.
Did you know? Had you heard?
You were sublime.
Katherina! I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going to write another aria for you. Something even more amazing for the second act. I have to get some water. Her mother is lying on the stage.
Hardly.
I'm not surprised. Money seems to be more important to him than loyalty or friendship. He has sold himself to Vienna. Let Vienna look out for him.
Don Giovannnnnnnni!
Stop it!
Because here everything goes backwards. People walk backwards, dance backwards, sing backwards, and talk backwards.
That's stupid.
No, this is serious. Say it backwards.
What?
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
Oh yes? You always know everything.
Well, don't do that again!
Tea? Who wants tea? Let's go out! This calls for a feast. You don't want tea, Papa. Let's go dancing. Papa loves parties, don't you?
I don't know.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Half the receipts! Stanzi!
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
Why not?
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
How charming.  But why did he not come himself?
He's terribly busy, sir.
Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
These are originals?
Not at all.
Where's our friend?
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
He's adorable!
Behold!
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Perhaps a little refreshment first? A little coffee, or a little chocolate?
My pleasure.
You please me, Court Composer. A very clever idea.
Oh, thank you.
What do you mean, Sire?
Majesty, may I ask you to do me the greatest favour?
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Would you tell me why?
I write to you with urgent news. I am coming to Vienna. Take no further steps toward marriage until we meet. You are too gullible to see your own danger. As you honour the father who has devoted his entire life to yours, do as I bid, and await my coming.
Pupils?
Yes.
It's a secret.
Thank you. That'll be fine. Don't spend any money on me.
I'm tired of this game. Please play without me.
Papa, is this your idea?
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Sssh!
Yes, well, it's all good fun.
Of course! What else do you think they speak here?
Wolfi!
What is this?
No.
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
But what is it they don't like?
What did you think of it yourself? Did you like it at all?
Did my work please you?
Who are you?
Finish what?
I think so.
We'll stop for just a moment. Then we'll do the Lacrimosa.
I can keep going, I assure you. Shall we try?
I am so ashamed.
You mean in Turkey?
Then why especially does it have to be in German?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Mozart, you are not the only composer in Vienna.
Mozart -
Herr Mozart -
Mozart -
Mozart, music is not the issue here. No one doubts your talent. It is your judgment of literature that's in question. Even with the politics taken out, this thing would still remain a vulgar farce. Why waste your spirit on such rubbish?  Surely you can choose more elevated themes?
I know a little. I studied it in my youth.
I can't say I do. What is it?
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
Why? Why? Why? Why add to your misery by confessing to murder? You didn't kill him.
But not his body.
Exactly.
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Herr Salieri.
Can we come in?
But he's all right?
He said 'Jack'.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
And what else?
Surely you're not suggesting...
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Could you get here without any trouble?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
I beg your pardon?
Yes?
I thought you were asleep.
Now what do you want to talk about?
I would think so.
The kitchen.
Charming.
There is only one bed.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Jack is dead!
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
Hello, Benjamin.
No!
Chart says he's from New York.
Miss Price.
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
What time is it?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
I really don't know.
She's a jerk.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
I assume full responsibility.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
Right.
Jack, we'd better go.
Could be a lot of things.
Shit! David, what is that?
What's the plan?
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Thanks a lot.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
David!
I'm not listening!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Nurse!
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
Then you have some hot tea?
Oh.
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!
Tom, I never had trouble getting credit from you before. When I was flat broke you gave me all the money I wanted. Now I come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest
She's a widow. I don't like taking mortgages from widows.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
I'll pay it back to you Saturday - on the level I will. Give a guy a break, will you? I've got to get it back in my account. If Helen ever finds out that I
Say pal, did you ever hear of a Depression?
What's the matter, Charlie?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
And tell him not to delay.
I think, Mr. Dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
I'm running this bank my way. Get that clear!
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
Why, I couldn't do that . . . !
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks
Yes, sir.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson. My wife is much better this morning.
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Why - well, I
In Mr. Sampson's office.
Good morning, Helen.
Good morning.
Sure, I think it's swell.
No. I won't.
But I haven't . . .
If he can do it, yes.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
Yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
With what?
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
Dickson's in a jam I tell you. The run's getting worse.
That's just what I'm trying to tell you, sir. It was a half hour after the Dooley sisters . . .
No - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
Everybody in?
You can ride like that?
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
These are deeds and mortgages of farms the bank was holding for the railroad.
How?
This is the best score yet.
Things changed when you quit the gang. For example, I'm now the one who says "Let's ride."
Yesterday.
Jesus mercy, that's Charlie Higgins, Dave Laller ...
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
Ride with me, cousin?
The James-Younger Gang.
I've robbed just as many banks as you have! I know this town, and I know this bank, and I say it's an easy job.
I'm out.
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
They gonna rush us?
Where is Jesse James?
You 'um big lawman?
Boys...
Distracting enough for you?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Hell of a war.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
It got to you, didn't it. All the killing in the war. You need it now.
Maybe it started out that way. But now...
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
Easterners.
You were little Jesse James when you left.
Jesse, is that your hand?
Teasing you is completely unfair.
I was thinking more along the lines of being a river pirate.
And what's this right girl like?
You and I, we've started... something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.
Oh, I'm not finished.  "When he sauntered into a saloon, his spurs jangling and his pockets full of gold, the ladies flocked around him like flies to a candied apple."  As I said. Hmm.
But I like the presidential suite.
Was it worth it?
You cocky little bastard.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
Jim, you been with a girl yet?
Well, not exactly.
I swear.
Gosh, that's a pretty name. Buy you a drink?
Devereux. My brother Cole dated a European girl once.
Relax, Alan. The Army has this all in hand. And Mr. Thaddeus Rains will be very pleased with this news. Nothing like a hanging to motivate the populace to relocate.
How can that be?
Really!
Unfortunately not, sir. A gang of local thugs managed to rescue him from the gallows. Not only has this inspired resistance from the other farmers, the redoubtable Mr. Alan Pinkerton was seriously injured during the incident.
THEN WHO DID?!
Sir?
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
No need. I have another tool at my disposal which will narrow it down to one bank.
What the hell is that sound?
Stop it. I'm...
Am I confused or were we talking about tonight?
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
Courtney? Dinner?
You like it there, don't you?
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
You know, Courtney, you should take some more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
It's a plain end, see? So?
Take it off.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
What are you doing tonight?
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
You have a really nice place here...Paul. How much did you pay for it?
Nothing like last time, promise.
Really?
This is nicer than your other apartment.
No-I can't take the time off work.
Why don t you just go for Price?
He's rich.
He's good-looking.
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
You're really serious, aren't you?
Yes, I am.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
How did you guess?
Yes, naturally.
Where are you going?
We are totally booked.
Two at nine? Perfect.
Anywhere you want?
Oh, I can't.  I don't know.
You can always he thinner. Look...better.
Do you have a boyfriend?
No, not really.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Jean-I'm not-
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
What do you think I do?
Welt...it depends, why?
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
What do you mean, she was a hot number.
She's my...cousin.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment.  Was that anything important?
Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL
You sure?
How well did you know him?
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
We were both seven in 1969.
Actually, yes.
What?
Nothing.
Isn't the Four Seasons a little far uptown? I mean aren't you going to be late?
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Great, yes, I'd like that.
But...everyone orders the hash browns here. I mean- it's-have you been here before?
So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did?
I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet?
I've questioned him.
He does? You're sure?
I checked it out. It's clean.
So who was he with?
I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?
Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
You like Huey Lewis and the News?
Yes, Owen?
It's important.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
I know, I know.
I don't know what I'm saying. Maybe -- maybe they hired those guys.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
Milo. Why would he --
What?
It's for the Museum. He knows you're a painter. If anybody should be invited --
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
It's just -- I kind of feel the need to do something with my ability. Create something...
Yes sir. I need to talk to you.
I -- just wanna help bring these guys to justice. They're neo-Nazis.
Let me look into it, see what's being done. Frankly, it's not my area.
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
What?
What?!
'Couldn't convince Teddy to come?
Milo? Gary Boyd. I'm hoping you and your friend can come up here. We've made some amazing strides in digital convergence. I'd love to show them to you.
Among other things... We know convergence is the real super-highway: all the PC's, TV's, phones, etc. linked together. Why cram it into a cable if you can use the whole sky?
How's it going?
You really wrote this just today?
I meant did you find other stuff to --
I hope you know what you mean to me. Not just because of what you're doing. Because of who you are.
'Knows I'm altering the coordinates. Let's jump to #12.
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
Just thought his work should go on.
You guys'll be using Teddy's old space, is that okay?
You calling Phil and Randy?
Right, right. But does he ever just, like, hand you code?
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
I know why you're so secretive. Why you won't let anybody near you.  I know what he did to you.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
A what?
What'd he say?
She called to apologize. I said I was pulling an all-nighter. She said then come home just to say Hi. Which I always do when we fight, it's suspicious if I don't.
Please don't go.
...You got my E-mail?
They're in the neighborhood. They usually hassle Vietnamese grocers.
Did you tell Alice?
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
What is it?
I could get it out of him.
Where is he?
You seem surprised to see me.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
I didn't, baby, you just told me.
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
Hello, Austin. This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.  You're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent Mrs. Kensington. The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone.
I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time. We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world.
You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997. You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years.
Thank you, Exposition.
Right away, Exposition.
She's working on another lead right now.
Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
Thank you, Basil.
Yes?
Excuse me?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
But, wait, I-- you got me again. Oh, and Austin--
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Why not? It's a question.
Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay?
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
My meat and two veg.
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Do I make you horny?
Let's go get him!
I hate having my picture taken.
Oh, yes you are.
It's not that I'm drunk, I'm just beginning to see what my Mum was talking about.  What was my mother like back in the Sixties? I'm dying to know.
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
You know who.
We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help. I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor.
Are you crazy?
Austin, I'm coming with you.
Kiss me.
Noooooooooooooo!
Quite impressive.
Thank you, Herr Doctor.
An evil vet?
Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'.
I'm proud of you.
Seriously?
There are limits?
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Love...
Flower ...
Promised? Who promised?
You are female?
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
People, too.
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
Peter Peel was a first class agent. A senior operative. 'X' department Special operations. He was engaged in top secret research. Top priority.  Government approved.
Good luck ... Peter ... Emma.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
Too many cooks --
Spoil the majority shareholders. In Wonderland Weather. I planned everything, even the Ministry recruiting you ...
I'm already married ...
Right, bridesmaid. Now what have I left out? Oh, yes, I know: the ring.
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
The result would be ...
Choices?
Rules are made to be broken.
And just what is the game?
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
Do we always follow Mother's instructions?
For a man in my position --
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
Any ideas?
Not quite. This is my field.
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
But if someone miniaturized the process...
That's what we were working on.
What, Lady Disdain? Are you yet breathing?
The Winslow Home for Retired Lepidoptorists. I'm so sorry I struck you, Mrs. Peel. Please forgive me. I thought you were someone else ...
I could save you the trouble.
Keeping a stiff upper lip?
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Aren't you coming?
They're playing your song, Mrs. Peel.
I'll be back ...
Have you any place in mind?
Who's now vanished.
'X' marks the spot. The shoes were delivered to ... an island in Hyde Park. Surrounded by the Serpentine. On the site of a former Ministry installation...
Steed
Possibly. Split personality ...
Something went wrong. System malfunction. Explosion. Mrs. Peel had a narrow escape. Suspected sabotage. Nothing proven. File still open.
You're accusing Mrs. Peel of killing her own husband?
I was hoping you could tell me.
I feel sure of it.
Debbie's marrying Rick.
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
I want Debbie.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
I'm marrying Debbie.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
No, Cole, I...
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
C'mon, I knew it was you.
Let's get naked.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Let's go.
Why is Cole here?
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
That's it.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
You okay?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
You're all under arrest. Open up!
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
I'm separated.
What's the matter?
Olivier's in that, right?
My gift to you.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
Oooooo.
I don't know.
Very.
Who?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Oh these moments do try me...
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
Hey, baby McCaffrey. First one's the clincher. You did okay.
It works.
I'm in heaven, Lt.
C'mon ladies, let's roll some hose...
Look, Brian, a photographer. Maybe I can get on the cover of LIFE magazine, too.
Christ, Stephen, let's wait for the hose team...
Had to take on another fire bare- handed, huh? Had to be fucking myth man in there instead of looking out for your probie. Is that what happened? Is it, Stephen?
Yeah? What have you got to do?  Look at you. Look at your face. All the things you must be thinking. Man, you must really hate my guts. Well, you know what? It's okay.
Look, Stephen, maybe we can talk about this some other --
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
What are we going to do about this?
Jennifer.
Well, if nothing else, it's nice to know we can still be friends.
Yeah. Swayzak. Humanity's last hope. How can you work for that guy?
I've been thinking about what you said the other night... If the offer's still on the table, I'd like to talk about it.
You think that's really any of your business?
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Thanks for the invite.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
I'll see ya around, huh?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
Sorry, but it's out of my hands. Try again next year.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
Even if it was used to seal the air off, that doesn't explain why someone would go to the trouble of a backdraft. A gun's a helluva lot easier
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!
But he killed these guys.
Hey boss, Dekom Trust is owned by Pan Illinois... which is majority controlled by Lakeside Dynamics... which is a division of Windy City Ventures... who's partners are...  Alan Seagrave, Donald Cosgrove, and Jeffrey Holcomb.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Then who wrote the report?
Yeah.
Another couple of good men get burned up for their city? Is that how it's going to read?  You're the only one that knows.
No need to be modest, Brian.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
How'd you know? These are supposed to be sealed.
Man. Something sure put a crimp in his evening.
Do you have to do that?
So, you surviving without me?
Management were pin heads.
"Laguna Jamming, Custom Surfboards"?
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
-- He's gettin' good on those eggs. And y'know, he told me he actually likes the piano.
Putty? On both doors?
Who's this?
Is he a fireman?  I like firemen.
And the world -- the whole world.
It knows us. This one knows us.
People.
You took the chalice.
Me?
I forgive you.
Large?
Fuck yesterday's game. The World Series is seven games not six. Put in my bet.
I'm not gonna let that bastard take my money
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
-- that there was never any other way it could have gone.  Never any other way. So you had better just put in my fucking bet. $120,000 on the last game. The Big One. Come on! Are you a bookmaker, or fucking what?
Father, if it was so trivial, so natural, so -- No. I have sinned. And you must listen if you are to prescribe an appropriate act of contrition, and to absolve me. Father, what would you do if you had but one day in which to use your arms to serve God?
Yo, Big Black, we needs a name for this joint.
...Benedict Arnold...
Same thing, y'knowwhatI'msayin', y'knowwhatI'msayin'!
Yeah!
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
Damn, Sis, you don't keep no food up in here in dis' piece.
You don't have the demographics.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
Meaning?
So that's what you been doing?
Damn skippy.
What kind of show is this gonna be?
What do I have to do?
You're now Mantan.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
Don't you people get it?  We're in the 21st Century.  Slavery was over four hundred years ago.  All that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over.  Folks always crying, white man this, white man that.  Let's all grow up.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting.
I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed.
I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom.
I'm not sure if I can deliver what you want.
Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo.
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.
The big mistake was my not believing in your genius earlier.  From the gitgo, from jump street.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
Sounds risky to me.
What is your problem?
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
Please don't go there.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
This is nothing.  It will blow over by tomorrow.
I don't believe it.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this?  Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Let Myrna finish.
You've never had any formal training, either?
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
I heard ya lady is wild.
You slept too near where you got in?
The good stuff.
I'm an asthmatic.  Been one all my life.  Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Oh you do, huh?
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
What is your uncle's name?
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Yes, sir.
Have you not a man whom you value?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
You want my heart?
Agreed.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Good night, my little darling.
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Dark Valdez.
What about Pike?
Before or after the explosion?  Mueller --
Why not?
He's lying.
So Childs made some side money, so what? People are dead, Ray, and the only one we have to blame is you --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
What business?
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Full clip to the body --
His chest was hamburger --
No. I said Dunbar.
How do you know?
I don't know --
They're taking your command, aren't they?
You're a good soldier, Bill.
Stay where you are.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
Three things. First -- You don't have a choice. Second -- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third -- I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.
Christ... Remind me to thank Bill for mentioning that on the phone --
Is Dunbar cute?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
Something like that. You?
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Why the fuck wasn't he in restraints?
Yeah.
So what now?
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
For what?
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
We need to talk --
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
What happened with Nunez?
This place is going, Mueller. We gotta move --
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
He's not Army, it's not official --
You want Kendall, don't you?
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong... it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.
What happens to Dunbar now?
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
Sir, yes, sir!
Sir, yes, sir!
Some of you may have heard there's a hurricane coming! American soldiers do not wait for good weather -- they do not wait for a bright sunshiney day to do their duty! An American Soldier learns to operate in the worst conditions and turn said conditions into an advantage against their enemy! Anyone who thinks these conditions are too harsh, feel free to lay down and die, you get me?
Yes!
Didn't kill anything, did I?
The town of Spectre. Best kept secret in Alabama. Says here you're from Ashton, right? Last person we had from Ashton was Norther Winslow.
Will.
Well, she... uh...
Eighteen.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Really.
You mean, while I'm here.
I will.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
The river.
Oh.
I've been working on this poem for 12 years.
Really.
How did you know my father?
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
You're not.
How did you get here?
We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that big really.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
How much time does he have left?
Mom?
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me £150.
No I don't.
Yeah it was okay.
What did he say?
Yes. I know.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
I understand. I'm so sorry
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He wants money.
Yes.
What?
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
No.
I don't hate you.
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
What happened between you and the blonde?
Except for Small Eyes.
Is the flight full?
How do you want to pay?
Oh! Gave me a start.
Angela?
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
You gonna sing me somethin'?
Hey.
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you.  Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
That young lady's size, right'cher.
I can't get Rae on the phone. She's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Better?
You sayin' you'll do what?
GODDAMMIT, RAE!
Two days?
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
Wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
You take it straight?
Want another?
No, you do it. I can't sing.
I don't want you to let go.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
Been years since I fooled with that.  You know a white girl? Dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
What'chu sayin'?
How a girl get like that?
You ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  Nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
Why's his britches round his knees?
This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
Ain't gonna be moved?
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?
The hell is this shit?
There you go, preacher man. Get me drunk so I don't stick my foot up yo ass.
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie.  Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
Hey.
Are you wasted?
I'm a what?
No. That's not why...  Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
-- I should tear your head off.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
Let's go.
I'd feel better if we had some heat.
Joyce can be nice.
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Give us a break...
How'd you get this?
What'd I tell you?
I want to go talk to him.
What's that for?
Louder, pal, louder.
Think we'll get him, Nick?
Don't give him any more.
Gaiijin?
I've heard of Sugai.  I've also heard of the emperor.  They're both national treasures.  One's a hood.
Keep the change.
She's such a long way home for you.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
This by this...
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
Why me?
Because I want you to tell me.
The other plate is currently in New York, in the hands of Kobo's man. Find it for me.
He knows what he's doing.
What's the problem?
I want more life, fucker.
Why?
Then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
I've done some questionable things.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.
You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
He could?
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
I want to do it.
She's not with you?
Well, when do you get paid?
Why, yes, of course.
Here's something you might find interesting.  They have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. However, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
I think I have no money.
You want to see my friends?
How old am I?
Yeah?
You're going to be over the limit.
I didn't know if I wanted to handle her -- I already got a snake act.  But my partner goes down there to the Opera House on suck night to book the good ones.
The best.
Does it eat?
Are you apprehensive?
Why should I be?
You become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
Last question.  You're watching an old movie.  It shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
Is there anything else?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
I've already got more help than I need.
Sounds like I'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
Dead.
What do people do in the afternoon?
Don't be fooled by appearances.
What's a long time?
What?
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Go ahead.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
Don't move.
Already had I.Q. test this year -- but I don't think I never had a...
What?
Know what a turtle is?
Mine's J.F. Sebastian.
I'm hungry, J.F.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Hi!
Bravo!
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
How do you do?
For how long?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
Get out of here!
I just had a mental picture of...
It was amazing.
You don't?
Wait!  Wait!
Over this?
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
I can't, it's yours.
I haven't brushed yet.
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Doing what?
How long would you need me?
Then forget it.
Bites what?
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Yes!
All right.
About clothing?
Hey, Eve!
No!  Not crazy!
What about her?
Okay. I like that.
You wanted to see me!
Eve?!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Uh-huh. Adam?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
I promise. Is that all?
That's what everybody believes?
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yeah?
I'm not wearing his pants.
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
What?
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
The sky?  Where?
I don't see anything!
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Sure.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
I'll be all right.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
The locks.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
No.
I've noticed.
No.  I think it's just right.
Watch this!
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
--and we will--
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
What are you bitching about now?
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Well, what do you think?
Um... Eve?
He go back to the hotel?
What's that mean?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
And if we can't find him?
Yeah! That's thinking.
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Suave. Goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
What is this? What color is it?
Jeffrey! Come on in.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!
How many times have you sneaked into girls' apartments and watched them undress?
No. Come on.
Do you like talk like that?
You can hit me, if you want to.
Go then. I can't let you put it in me now but I want you. I like you.
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Are you a bad boy?
What do you want?
I want you to hurt me.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Beeeee careful.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
I did. Are you?
I want you to stay with me.
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
Oh no.
They hurt his head.
He's comin' back? What for?
Frank?
Hello?
No thanks. What does that mean?
I don't want to go.
On a ride.
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
Nothing.
Right here Frank. You want me to pour it?
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
God, you scared me.
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
No. No thank you.
How is Central these days?
What else is new? Right?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Didn't my father tell you not to talk about it? 
There were at least three, maybe four. But a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. There's also a business man over by the Franklin factory district that was questioned. And a musician. And some others.
I don't want to cause any trouble.
I don't know, it sounds like a good daydream, but actually doing it is too weird. Too dangerous.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Thanks. Dorothy Vallens. Okay, goodluck. Three minutes, no sooner.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Yeah, but don't pick me up. My father may think it's strange. I'll walk over to your house. I'll be there at eight o'clock.
Here's to. An interesting experience.
Why not?
OK.
Well, how did it go? What happened?
Okay, be careful.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now, the only trouble is, what does this prove?
I'm seeing something that was always hidden. I'm involved in a mystery. I'm learning. And it's all secret.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Mike's gotta go.  Nice to meet you.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
I need Il Duce.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
There's ways around that.
Lord's name.
Look, look! I'm not saying one way or the other. Just be careful and go by the protocol on this one.
The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
Don't you think that's a little psycho? A little weird?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!
What did I fuckin' do?... in the middle of the Lakeview.
I finally found your Da's army revolver, Connor.
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
How many?
How do you think he figured all this out without talking to us?
We'll find it. Just calm down.
These are not polite suggestions. They are codes of behavior and those that ignore them will pay the dearest cost. 
They were wearing masks.
I killed your fuckin' cat, you druggie bitch!
Your what, bitch? I'll shoot myself in the head, you can tell me that cats name! Go ahead... Your what? Your precious little... 
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
And the pennies?
It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
A guy went nuts over off of Commonwealth today. Shot three guys to death in a coffee shop in broad daylight. Fled the scene. Don't have much on him.
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
After talking to the dancer we know that their mark was the guy in the middle booth. After she watches them whack him, she passes out.  Why the two extra victims?
They weren't related. The guy used a 38. No pennies. Totally amateur.
Right now.
Who says that? You could take credit on it.
Liberating isn't it?
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
You feel?
Yes.
Have you no fear of God?
What do you want me to say?
Poppa Joe, you want me to go now?
I always see you talking to the boys and making them laugh. They always come around telling me what a crack up you are. What is it they call you?
He's a nigger.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
See, that's what I'm saying. It has the logic of a dream.
Now that window can never be locked. It's impossible.
How was I ridiculing you?
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Look at the treads on those.
What about them?
Look, man. She didn't know anything about shirts.
May I have a word with you, please?
She's from Cuba.
Now that makes sense. We'll hang out for a couple of days. Get a little R&R. Make sure Future Man's OK and then get back on the road.
This was in fourth grade.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
Where was I?
I wish I'd been there.
She doesn't need to know.
Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
What exactly is this place? Freezers?
You could give somebody a concussion.
Shit, Dignan.
Eleven fifteen.
Next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
We all set?
I'm in position, Scarecrow.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?
It's the fire alarm. Somebody pulled the fire alarm.
Where's Kumar?
I'll see you there.
You're living on a sailboat?
I think I may have found a way out of here.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Congratulations. You passed the test.
Yes, he did.
I don't want to die.
Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
Exactly. Woah.
Why'd you want to help us?
What the fuck is Dignan doing with that cop? He loves them.
Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Dies y nueve.
Like silk?
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
S. Cooper Trust, in San Francisco?
Are you a fag?
I don't know about that.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
I thought your parents were in Italy.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
That's good. Keep it at forty.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
It's registered in my mother's name.
What the fuck possessed you?
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
Don't "Come on, Dignan" me.
Future Man would never go to jail for you, I'll tell you that.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.
Bob, you're lying!
Is he in?
The grammar?
Yes.
What's the story?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?
No. I just have short hair.
How's the weather down there?
I want to know about Treadstone.
What happened? Jason Bourne happened.  You've got the files? Then let's cut the crap. It went wrong. Conklin had these guys wound so tight they were bound to snap. Bourne was his number one -- guy went out to work, screwed the op and never came back. Conklin couldn't fix it, couldn't find Bourne, couldn't adjust. It all went sideways. Finally there were no options left.
What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin!
Moscow? What the Hell's he going to Moscow for?
Sir...
Is it a slam dunk? No, but...
Show me again...
It changes things. That knowledge. Doesn't it?
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Felt a little light.
What do you want?
Where were you, Jason? In the car.
I worry when you get like this.
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
Where are you going?
But you found another choice.
I did.
See that tram coming around the corner?
What do you mean?
Your first assignment was Geneva.
What do you want?
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
You're sure?
Who's this?
How long have you worked for the agency?
Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They had physical symptoms -- headaches -- sensitivity to light --
Believed what?
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
Anything?
By who?
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
I will invade England. And defeat the English on their own ground.
A thousand.  You have made me Guardian of Scotland. So I tell you this is what we face.
We cannot defeat this --
Does anyone know his politics?
He won't come.
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
The weapon has been outlawed by the Pope himself!
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
Good day to you, M'Lords.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
I rest.
Nor I! I want to live! I want a home and children and peace. I've asked god for those things. But He's brought me this sword. And if He wills that I must lay it down to have what He wants for my country, then I'll do that too.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
We'll get those English pigs tomorrow.
We don't split up!
I am the one who is rotting. But I think your face looks graver than mine.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
Some nights. I have dreams. Mostly dreams I don't want. I started riding at night to fill up my mind so that when I did sleep I'd dream only of the ride and the adventure.
But I won't give you up to any nobleman.
Shush. It's only been a day.  And it's seemed like forever.
I'm dreaming.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
Come, it'll help you sleep.
Anything.
A journal. Just have him write down everything he does.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
What happened?
Just. Like. Jason.
What did you see? What did it look like?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
Books?
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
Wow. That must've taken some courage.
Hey, uh, don't go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Like how?
Ha! Where's that?
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
I still owe you an essay from last week. Is there any way I could get an extension?
You knew the whole time, didn't you?  When you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. Didn't you?!
What do you need it for? I don't get you lately.
Duly noted. Now I'm gonna ask you for one last favor.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
Hurry! Let's go! Get him up, Evan! Come on!
Shut up, Tommy!
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
I came with Captain Renault.
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Thank you, but I hardly think --
How long can I afford to stay closed?
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I'd better be going.
It's not for sale.
You haven't heard my offer.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
And I was wondering.
Yes?
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
I didn't count the days.
I don't know the finish yet.
How did you get in?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
When will he be back?
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
Goodnight.
What happened with Rick?
Yes, Victor, I was.
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
My office.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
You love her that much?
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Even in Berlin.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
A leader, like Laszlo?
But I have no excuse to close it.
What, again?
Oh, how do you do?
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
Oh, no, Rick never --
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
Sam's piano.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
You ever going to bed?
No. Not me, boss.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
Shut up and go home, will you?
Where is she? Have you seen her?
Come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
They're always on autopilot.  Or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  They'll never see you.
I float.  You sink.  End of story.
What did it matter if FedEx was five minutes late one day?  The next day we just start over again.
You can't make it.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
I can't believe this.  I -- I -- They are... You're a gifted artist.  You're into something very powerful.  Primal. Truly.
I had it on the island with me.
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that.  Did you get it fixed?
Got to follow the paper path here.
What do you want me to say?  That I thought I'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  That I might as well have gone sailing for all the good I did?
Hey, look at you.
"We're" not over-reacting.
No.
I'm sorry about the presents.  I got a little carried away.
What's that, written on the sail?
Yeah?
I need the latest PDRs on St. Petersburg.
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
I am one lucky guy.
Thought you were going to bring her.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
Trying.
Can you find her?
Forget it.
Malaysia's tanking.  We're meeting in ten in operations.
You were how long on this?
To life.
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to *replace* me!
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
Why not?
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
And that I can drive a truck!
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
I better go.
You don't miss it?
I *know* this was right.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
*Go* anywhere? Of course not! That would be *doing* something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to *do* something. Let's just sit here all night!
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
Nobody special enough, Curly.
I don't know! He's just leaving--  you're the one who says he needs to see the world!  *That's* what he'll do--he'll see the world!
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
You mean they'll replace you with someone who won't perform abortions.
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
Have you enlisted?
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with *you* performing them.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually *disintegrating*--my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
It looks like scurvy.
In other words, scurvy.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
I bet the view looks better from the Worthin'tons'.
Does it *snow* in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a *coffin*!
Why was he missing for twenty days?
Mind your own business, Peaches.
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
Rose Rose has runned away!
Tough day?
Listen, what I'm about to tell you, I'm telling you in confidence, okay?  Have you ever heard of a company called Big.Com?
Same thing with playing a con. You have to be able to see that deep.
I can see why you liked her.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
You know what we're doing with the money.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
Let me rephrase -- I won't do that.
I need you to stake me.
Stake you?
Special Agent Gunther Moonan. Ring a bell?
Well he's in town and he sure as shit remembers you. What are we going to do about this Jake? We can't afford to have a Fed onto us.
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
What brings you down from Boston, Jake? Taking advantage of the long weekend?
What is this? You guys cops or something?
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
What about Customs?
You need to get a haircut.
Intuition. It doesn't make you Yoda. Like tonight. You killed that guy tonight. But I knew you would.
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
Lily... Jesus Christ...
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
You tell them the "Tale".
Meet me at my place later.
Why?
Then what do you want to do, Miles? Run?
Him.
Your buddy. That fat guy. The King couldn't wait to have that guy whacked. He didn't even know who the guy was, but he was so pissed off at him, he gets him drilled. It ain't personal. It's business.
Point, Lupus. Give us a point.
Egg Foo Young.  Stand up.
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
The King, huh? Nice going.
Jack Manfred.
I can imagine.
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now.  You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
How about fifteen hundred?
How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
All right. As what?
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
She's a dab hand With a racquet, your friend.
A bit unexpected, wasn't it?
I've got a job.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Do you have to swear all the time?
I'm on at nine.
I don't like it.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
There was a message, wasn't there?
Nothing about you.
I hate public transport.
It's not that.
For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion. 
So how are you doing, dad?
First visit to London?
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Near the casino.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
Just an accident. Nothing.
I owe a lot of money.
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Is it yes?
You did?
I'm Lucy.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
I'm off to a little watering hole. Why don't you join me? Relax.
Loosen up, Jack. If you don't, this job'll get to you. The pressure's too much, believe me, it'll break you.
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
Thanks for the information.
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
I have a reduced drive reading of seven thousand.
No, no, the key, the key to the fail- safe lock!
The key!
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Do you remember the detonation time?
Therefore, I shall ignore you.
Snap out of it, bomb.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?
To explode, of course.
And you can only do it once, right?
Yes, well...
Yes, of course you remember it, but what you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.
So if you detonate in...
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.
Wha?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.
-- automatic channels open --
It's funny, but I kind of sit around, you know, a lot of time to myself...
...Somewhere in the autonomic relay circuits...
Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?
Sh, Talby, don't bother me now.
Not now!
What was that, Doolittle?
Commander Powell? Commander, hello!
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Men... men... what happened, men?
Bruno's girlfriend.
I'm on a break.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
Man, you got a bad attitude.
How come I never hearda you before?
You mean until you showed up?
So you just decided to return it to the sender.  Or, in this case, the sender's wife.
Must think you're pretty special laying this on you.
What else can we do?
I know, Honey, but just think how exiting it will be-- new house, new school, new friends--
Who is...
Sorry about your window.
Lemme get my coat.
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
You got a lotta nerve.
Me?  You're the one who tried to rip off this piece.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
Like extra virgin olive oil, the best of the best.
They've lost track of me and I plan to keep it that way.
On accounta you, Sonrisa didn't get to buy off the jury, or kill the judge. He's gone.  Once and for all.  It was war, Max, and you won.
I don't know what to say.
Maybe we got screwed outta living in a time when we could sit in a cafe, sipping our lattes wearing two thousand dollar wrist watches while we plan our next vacation.  But the world got a whole lot meaner all of a sudden.  Wasn't s'posed to, but it did.  And it's back to the law of the jungle.  You got your predators and you got your victims.
But she does work here?
None.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
I think you should go now.
This is not a place you wanna go.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
He got the car in a trade for his old pick-up and some food...no bill of sale or nothing.  It was right after the pulse so all the DMV records were wiped.  So we don't get anything on the seller.  Except I actually managed to find this guy, six hours on the phone... Say thank you.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike.  Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes.  So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
What guys do.  'Nother order.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
And because he's my friend.
They're prisoners to their genes.
Only way you're ever gonna find out is reincarnation... Fact is, you are gonna pay me, and I am gonna provide you with a service.
Who are you?
It's payday, need me to pick up your check?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
We gotta talk.
I don't see how you cheating on Natalie involves me.
Max--
I'm a toy to her.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
How'd you get her out of town?
And we're sure Lydia's gonna make her move?
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
Huh?
Gin.
Well, Amanda, this has been quite a night. So far you've seen me and my dick throw up.  What's next? Projectile diarrhea?  Man. What a stud, huh?
Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
What's it worth to you?
Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids?
Wonder if you could smoke shit out of this?
Well, the least we, his only buds in the world, can do is take him along with us tonight and give him one last curl before he starts serving his sentence.
You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
...Holy shit! I am in absolute trouble! I never should have let you drive, man! Absolute fuckin' trouble!
The KISS tickets, you nimrod! They're just fuckin' gone! Please tell me you have'm!
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.
It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
Hey, Look at the front entrance! A car's pulling out. The parking space from heaven. God is surely smiling down upon us tonight, dudes.
Change? What's wrong with what I got on?
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
What do you want?
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
Yeah.
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
Beg pardon?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad.  He has... emotional problems.
It's like this big force... that's in your brain. But sometimes it grows bigger... and it spread down into your arms and legs... and it just sends you someplace.
No. Every time I wake up somewhere different. Sometimes my bike is laying there next to me. Like once when I woke up on the edge of this cliff up on Carpathian Ridge.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
That's alright... I understand.
Are you okay?
Will you please talk to me?
My mom is gone.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Know what?
Oh, shit!
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
I think I already have.  But now she won't even talk to me.
I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
I think he saved my life.
Don't you watch the news?
Gretchen. We're going together now.
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
How many times have you seen Frank?
Four times... so far.
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Have you told Gretchen about the spears?
People get hurt.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
If God exists?
Why would I tell Mom?
Because you tell Mom everything.
What else?
Do you even know who Graham Greene is?
Rose.
There's no rule!
What is this shit?
Smurfette doesn't fuck.
You're what?!
You-betcha.
My mom wanted me to have this?
Oh, shut up. I thought it might help you get some sleep.
Okay.
Oh, Amber...
I -- I'm wearin' this costume. I'm, uh, I'm gonna do my talent tonight.
Amber...
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
I hate her!
What?
So, anyone talk to Janelle?
Yeah...
And the bite marks on my ears?
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.
Are we on "Cops" again?
This here's Loretta.
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
Okay?
Wisconsin.
Tammy Curry?
Oh, Lester. He loves his weather, y'know.
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Iris, stop!  It's not his fault. The communal wine just proves too temptin' for some of them.
It's a two-hundred dollar fine!
Okay, everybody, listen up!
This is -- what?
Well, Mom's dead, so shut your fly trap.
Harold!
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
That's not right yet... put back "President" and take out "dear"... How does it read now?
"My"...
I've tried to chase him but it's no use - he won't go -
Who to?
Yes -- why?
Have you got a license?
He only weighs ten ounces --
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
Then we've gotta start one. Do you know how to start a war?
You no gotta no gun.
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started...  Get out there and fight... 
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
I will not stand for anything that's crooked or unfair; I'm strictly on the up and up, So everyone beware. If anyone's caught taking graft And I don't get my share, we'll stand 'em up against the wall - and pop goes the weasel!
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
I don't remember.
No, that wasn't it...
Your Excellency, the eyes of the world are upon you.  Notables from every land are gathered here in your honor --  This is a gala day for us.
Your Excellency, you mustn't forget your appointment at the House of Representatives... Have you got your speech ready?
Oh, Rufus!
Oh, Your Excellency, I don't know what to say.
So -- you've come to ask for clemency! I'll give the enemy no quarter -- not a dime...
But Your Excellency -- the Ambassador is here on a friendly visit...  He came to ask you to patch up the breach.
But -
Ambassador Trentino, I am indeed honored...  But you see - well - I --
This is all Firefly's fault -- that idiot, that fool...
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
They have noble faces.
Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
Yes?
Aw, Bytes, he's sick.
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
Don't!
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
You don't own this man!
A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
Oh yes?
Treves. Well done.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
Three quarters of an hour.
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
Oh, no.
Well, even to work there would be wonderful. Is it beautiful?
Oh no?
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Say hello to London for me. I miss her.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
I'll have to find some more.
...Yyes
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
My name is...
John... Merrick
Say "Mmmerrick."
Why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? Why didn't you tell me you could read?
It's very good. I'm enjoying my visit with you very much. It's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself.
Not at all, John.
The children! May I see?
Good morning, John.
You want a dressing bag, John?
Yes John?
Goodnight John. Sleep well.
Yes... Well, I want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. And bring up another breakfast. When you've done that, you and I shall give the man a bath. But, Mothershead, I'm counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, Above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
Thank you, Mothershead. Have a porter put them in my office.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
She did, I tell you! She could blind me as easily as the night the day.
Where's the Cloak Invisible?
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
The second note.
LOKI! Where did YOU come from?
What do you see, Erik?
Well... for a start... er... there's no killing...
Well, OBVIOUSLY there's no killing.
Would you like us to sing to you?
Oh, no no no! It's just the Horn Resounding is...
I'm sure it's lovely.
The Gods are asleep, King Arnulf.
You don't know Halfdan the Black.
Me? Of course! I've been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
No... right... this is RAPE... Mark you, I'm not saying I couldn't get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, I prefer it when there's some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
You DON'T like it, do you?
Louder.
Why should you care?
Why should you care?
How deep IS the ocean?
What's wrong with making friends?
You talking piffle, son?
I want to die...  No, I don't!
But you're the Gods!
You mean we'd be dead?
Now stop it!
That's true.  You'd better sit there.  You there, and Ornulf there.
Just say something cheerful.
I think we should go...
I AM one, Dad!
She hasn't got any.
Hy-Brasil?
Sven!
How did he do that?
He hasn't.
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Oh! Who cares? We're HOME!
I'm not worth risking your life for.
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Honour and protect all blacksmiths.
It's a tradition.
So did my father and his father before him.
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
And his "you'll never be a Berserk if you lose your temper"...
No... he's not... not... there...
And don't forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.
I did. You said, things were fine.
I remember.
Shit. The last time I saw you.
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
I'm not a stalker.
Yeah.
So you like bookstores, huh?
What?
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Yeah?
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
Yeah.
No, not at all.
Yo ho ho!
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
Yeah, Tangerine?
No.
Such a beautiful view.
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
You remember what happened next?
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
I'm sure, I said.
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
I remember that speech really well.
You had the whole human race pegged.
Hi there.
Oh God, how horrid.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
Seems too coincidental that way.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
What are you doing?
Make love?
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
God, I can't believe I ever hated you.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
Yeah, I tried you at home. Did you get my message?
Right! She called me an old lady here, too! And I remember, I said...
How's the chicken?
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
You have to stop this!
What?
We'll speak soon.
Very cool. Trippy.
Definitely!
We haven't checked.
That's a good one.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
Yeah.
It's stopped.
Hey.
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
What do you want, Stan?
Mary...
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
That's lovely.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
We can't do this.
I have a family, Mary.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
Does that help?
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
I'm staying with the Countess.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Tell me about it.
No, I guess not.
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
What do you think?
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
Yep.
I'm the best.
Bonanza Jellybean?
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
But Countess...
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
I don't know anything about it.
Ballast.
Time to play Spam in the can.
The containment, Second Containment...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
We haven't tested the air yet. It could be contaminated...
Hear what?
What happened?
Please...
Please... kill...
What's wrong?
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
What's on your mind?
What, Justin, what shows you?
Oh my god OH MY GOD...
...I don't want to die...!
But I can't... I gotta get out of here... Skipper, please...
No, no, its alright. I talked to my ex, he'll keep Denny over Christmas and I'll get him this summer.  Goddam it, Skipper... I haven't seen him in two months.
Everything's been shut down. Conserving power, I guess. Green light on the hull, it's intact.
Alive?
Justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. Peters...
Skipper...
I want this room sealed. The Second Containment is off limits.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
If you miss me, you'll blow out the hull. You'll die too.
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
What are you trying to say? "If God had intended Man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
But...
Captain Miller, you copy?
Thank you.
Now what?
Radiation interference?
It tastes bad.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?
Weir activated the drive. He's sending us to the Other Place.
Dr. Weir, what's this the door to?
He's engaged the override.
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
What?
I can't believe this, I haven't gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. Why not Mars, Cap, Mars has women...
If they are, they're screening their calls.
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
Miller, do you read me, Peters --
What is it?
I'm not really dressed for a party.
Where is Reed?
What is this? Where's Reed?
He's financed some of the biggest breakthroughs of this century.
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
They crashed it into a wall. A flight simulator.
Five times.
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
It's about to be a broken face.
'Course not. Strictly business.
What's wrong with me?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible. The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben. You had the best --
The machine works. And Vic's gone Mister Hyde on us --
But... this disease... is progressive... degenerative...
I though we went over this.
Twenty? From outside the place looks a lot taller.
Johnny. SUPERNOVA.
The synthetics act as a second skin, adapting to your individual needs to --
Flame on, flame off. Flame on, flame off --
What is that thing?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
And if he's not...?
Leonard, how's the feed?
How's the IPO?
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
Those solar winds are flaring, but I factored them into my coordinates and --
What?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Not until Ben is back inside!
Didn't go as planned? It was a catastrophe. You ruined the lives of four people --
I understand the business reasons.
What's going on?
Victor, I'm sorry I --
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?
How much did they cost?
Brad. I don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
First door on your left!
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is?  What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over.  So who do you have first period?
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Is everything okay at work?
You are a virgin!
I didn't say that.
Any problems?
Did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
You're a really good kisser.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
What? Are you all right?
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
All right... where did you see her?
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Well, I've gotta be running.
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
So what makes you so sensitive?
Lust For Life. It's the story of Vincent Van Gough.
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.
Should we buy a frame for that?
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
What variables?
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
No. But it's a nice idea.
Dartmouth?!
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
What class?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
The point sounds fine.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Joey at Cinema Four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
Really?
Anything to drink?
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please?
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
They're everywhere. Nobody's safe. And sure as hell not in the South. They like warm weather... You'd never believe it. In L.A. it's out of control. First it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.
I'm a whiskey man myself. We don't have much trouble from drugs where I come from...
You will. One of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.
What happened? What did they do to her?
God hell! I think I see the pattern! This one sounds like real trouble! You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over. As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine. And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts...  This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves.
Where's the medicine?
God didn't do that! You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig!
Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side.  Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor?
Look over there. Two women fucking a Polar Bear.
I have to go.
OK. I'll lend you some money. Let's go outside and see how much we have left.
Good God! Let's get out of here! Where's the elevator?
Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose.
That dirty bastard! I knew it! He's got hold of my woman!
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
You cheap honky sonofabitch...
You degenerate pig!
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
I figure she can do about four at a time. Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day. Maybe three.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
What's wrong with you? Hell, somebody has to do it.
Sure. It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.
I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies. But the room was quiet again.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
So do we, lady.
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
What made you do it? Who paid you off?
You realize...
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?
Well, it don't look pretty.
I got my .38 here. That's six shots and two refills. Downstairs, I think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. Maybe a couple boxes of shells for The Judge.
Well, your last words can be "I told you so."
And that's how I ended up here.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
Scared?
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
What's in the back?
My husband...
Easy. We're surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. Some kind of animals. Real fast, volatile, predators. ONE went through three of your patrons like they were Kleenex.
He only shot you once.
Go for it. It's by the far wall. A small wave band. Channel 9 is the emergency frequency. But I don't see the point.
What do you mean what?
Is it gassed up?
Sit still, look less like a meal.
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
DON'T!
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus... Never, ever, never let you go.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
I'm fine, I really am.
I'll do anything to help.
Um, well...
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
'Forgive'...? For What?
Good morning, Mr. Bebe!
Okay. Good tits. Can't we show them off a little more?
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I'm not!
Madam...?
What's up?
What does Clifford say?
Dick, we need some time apart --
Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
We're all square now, Harry. Right?
I know you believe that.
Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
But I'll never win that.
Yes, yes, it's all arranged. Everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is: the trip returns you to New York.
No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
But, Kurt, I...
I'm really sad it's closing. Now what am I gonna do on Tuesday nights?
I wouldn't miss it.
You sound as if you hate it.
Aren't you ever going back?
Just one minute...
Not me. But other people seem to.
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Well? What'd you think?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really... there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.
...So you think I should go.
Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make good money at it.
You don't know what you want.
What?
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
That's right.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
Look, Frances, I'm only gonna ask this one time. I mean it. I swear after this, I'll never ask again: Will you marry me?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
Frances, it's me, Harry?
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Oh, you...  ...ennh.
Shit!
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
What happened? Who're you?
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
You got it.
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
You kill me, Mama.
What?
Oh! Are you really?
...Did you really say that?
I'll have someone show you to your room.
Do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
You what?
I'm sure you'll see it my way in the end.
You drove him to his torment.
Better that way... for me.
I'm... very, very ugly. People are afraid. Except you.
Fine words from a child killer. You who murdered my brother.
Materials. Nothing more.
Friend?
I do know that for the sympathy of one living being, I would make peace with all.  I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. And rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will demonically indulge the other. That choice is yours.  You're the one who set this in motion, Frankenstein.
And if I consent?
Why... her?
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
Elizabeth, really! He's quite mad!
So have I
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
What does it say?
Is he not back yet?
Smell the air. Wonderful.
This feels... incestuous.
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
I thought I'd never see you again!
Brother and sister no more.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
This ice will break yet.  How's our guest?
You're saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
No. But someday.
You can't. Death is God's will!
Is that your diagnosis?
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together.
Or Albertus Magnus. Cornelius Agrippa...
What is your name?
Victor, explain yourself.
Preposterous.
Electricity.
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
You know of it?
It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
You can only do what you can do.
How the... did he get in there?
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
Do you have a dime? A quarter?
How come?
I don't believe you...
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
He keeps on acting like such an asshole!
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?
Best over...
Anything else you want?
How much do I owe you?
One night on the town.
Good luck.
Just my son and I.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
I don't know, one place's as good as another.
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
Twenty-eight.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.
Who else?
Before we stepped in here, you told all of us to be cool. That means you, too.
I never said do what I do, I said do what I say.
Well, I say lets tear this place apart for weapons. So when they burst through that door, we'll make 'em wish they never did.
You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
I promise.
What?
What you said to me in the room.
Daddy's dead.
Best in Mexico.
You believe me don't cha?
No.
Do they have an X-rated channel?
That's their standard deal, brother. They ain't about to change it for us.
All I'm saying --
Shit, I started to get worried. Where the fuck ya been?
Richie, it's gonna get a lot fuckin' worse before it gets any fuckin' better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed Texas fuckin' Rangers. They ain't gonna stop lookin' till they find us, and when they find us, they're gonna kill us. Texans take it very personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police have already started a motel and hotel search for us.
This ain't the time.
Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the- wall's gonna have my fuckin' prescription.
I'm lookin' scared?
Where are you?
Well, then ask her, dumb ass.
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
B.O.Q., south side.  Take a starboard tack out the door.
Your prerogative, Senator.
Awright.  How's our girl doin', anyway?
Uh, V.I.P. security arrangements generally take some time, Senator.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Shit.  Think we're had.
"The Lark Report."
It should.  You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
You'll think about my offer?
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Close as I can get, el-tee!
Just do it, okay?
If you can't feel the other guy's pecker, you ain't in tight enough! I want nuts to butts!
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
The Chief was granted early retirement as of 17-hundred yesterday.  By 18-hundred he was gone.  Out of the Navy.
By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here?
Just like you would be.
I don't feel like doing an option paper on the rest of my life, Jordan.  Maybe we should just let it happen.
That bad?
And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for...
It's done with, Royce.  Let it go.
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
Which is guy-speak for...
You got anybody, Wick?
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
Aw, lookit this, lookit this -- she's bringin' Tampax in here. C'mon, you got nothin' but rooms over there.
Maybe we should call the Coast Guard.
This ain't workin' right!
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared?
He stole my report! That's my report!
Think we can fit up in there?
So, you still picking apart cockroaches?
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?
And exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
The network is on an intranet. It's a direct feed into our computer system.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
Who is he?
Did Romeo have a name?
Remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
Just tell me, did you talk with him?
Caiman, wait. Take me with you.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
We? I don't think so.
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Merde!
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
It's Tatopoulos.
Somebody must have seen it.
What are you suggesting?
You gave them the tape?
General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park...  We should be able to take him down.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Do I know you?
I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that?
Thanks.
You don't hold a thruster down! It's for quick boosts
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
That's your problem.  You were never serious about the caraft...  "I'm a rock... I just want to be a rock... Still. Peaceful.. Tranquil.." ..."Oh, but what's this?  Something's making noise... No, not noise, no... MOVEMENT.  VIBRATIONS.  Make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... I must CRUSH the thing that makes the vibrations..."
He wants to THINK!?
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
You have a better plan, Alex?
No I didn't.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
Okay, now left at the next turn... Past the oxygen units.  Make a right there. Then go through the antimatter vent...
What?  Up?
That's It?
Never mind, Fred....
The digital conveyer?  You mean I'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
As good as Hopkins?
How do you remember this stuff?
It's... I don't know.
I know...  You contruct a weapon.  Look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
This isn't mine. Wait, where is that kid?...
It's Jason...
Wait. When are you going to tell them?
Are you kidding? I'm not going to tell them.
All right, now nobody panic, I've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
I made the CUT THE LINE gesture. You nodded okay.'
Uh... I hate to break it to you Jason, but I don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a Learning Annex course I don't know about, I'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
What IS that thing? It serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of CHOPPY CRUSHY things in the middle of a CATWALK!?.'
You should have let me hit him.
JASON  You think you could-get any closer to those mines?
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Stop, please! I don't know!
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
But Commander... The negotiation... You... You... You fired on him.
Theramin.
But what if Sarris survives?
Mathesar?. .. Has Sarris seen the.. historical records?
Former Commander?
You what?.. What are you talking about?
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
Continue forward, sir?
Unfortunately, I'll never get the chance.  I'm leaving in an hour for Congress to scream like a violated virgin about my promotion.  Wasting my time, naturally... Look at her teasing those bumpkins.
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Damn-it!  You've given us a whole new season, Benedict!  And Congress thinks that the British are going to ride right over us come spring. Now half their army is back in Canada.
I'm sure his dogs will be overjoyed.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
Wil...
Captain Alexander Hamilton, sir!
We've got powder but no ball!
I'll be twenty next year, sir.
It's impossible to stop these men deserting in winter, you might as well stop geese from migrating.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
If he supports the British why is it that every time he gets near them he kills so many of them?  Unlike General Lee... who you and Congress backed for second in command and who is a goddamned incompetent!
George, I'm sorry.  We all know the army will acquit Arnold...
Makes you gag.
General Lee is detained captain...
Unofficially, General Greene.
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
These supplies...?
And how rusty are these muskets?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army.  There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal.  They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
What's the point of a revolution if it doesn't?
I want you to see our hospital.
It isn't my army yet, Colonel Greene.  Looks like you've seen some action -- did you hurt your leg, in a fight?
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
They're for my bodyguard.  I have an absolute conviction that Arnold is planning to have me assassinated!  It will be harder if I am surrounded by a body of men who look like me, don't you think?
Why?  Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
All people have rights!
You hear that?
Shit, now someone's gotta climb down there and get him.
I think I pulled my quadriceps.
Sure. Family. I know how that goes.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie "Fingers".
With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
I really think I can be of service on this one.
In just a second. Two...
Alright, Bo. You can have the money... but it's not here. I have to go get it.
Bo. I'm great. Listen, I'm expecting some people -
You serious?
I don't know.
Who is this?
Look at me, Ray.
How'd you get in here?
Look, there's no reason you and I shouldn't get along. Forget all the bullshit from before - I don't even remember how it started. You took a swing at me over some fuckin' thing, whatever it was - forget it. You owe me some money, right? Forget that too. But, you don't say a fuckin' word about this to anybody. It's strictly between you and me, right?
Who the fuck are you?
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
A marker's like a check, Harry.
You want to hear this idea? It's about a dry cleaner who scams an airline out of three hundred grand. Go on, tell her.
You just did.
What?
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
He died.
It was in the Herald.
Twenty seven hundred.
Yeah. That was a good party.
You know, Marty, you were good in The Cyclone.
Guy owes me fifteen large and takes off, I go after him. The fuck you think I do?
No, I want you to look at me the way I'm looking at you. Put it in your eyes, 'You're mine, asshole,' without saying it.
Compass.
It's all mine.
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?
A hundred and fifty-six. Some'll charge you more'n that, go as high as six for five on a short-term loan. So three a week's not too bad.
Hey... Karen. How ya' doin'?
No, no... you left the patio door open. You gotta stop doin' that, all the nice things you got around here.
Rough day on the set?
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
This thing's actually accurate. I bought it for ten bucks from a kid in a lawn chair on Sunset...
You don't like Martin much, do you?
Oh, I like him. I just think he's... short. I mean, he's a good actor and all, but I'm wondering what it was exactly you saw in Marty.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
You thought I was faking?
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
I'll be right back.
No, I said I'm never goin' to bed. There's a difference. See, the article says most people die in their beds. I figure long as I stay outta bed, I'm safe.
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
That's great, Harry. So what's the --
Hello, Doris.
Be quiet and listen.
Yeah, well I turned off the set. I used the remote control thing and laid it on the floor. You know what could've happened? The dog came in and stepped on it, turned the TV back on.
Oh, for Christ's sake -
Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel?
Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over.
Are you crazy? Do you realize we got ourselves a ship? We own a ship, Dodge.
Let's not be too hasty.
I need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. And sheet metal. Preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. Aluminium, even tin'll do.
I ain't no mechanic, just so you know.
Roger?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Ready?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
Try Wednesday.
Get up.
Mother fucker!
What's this?
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
Hard to say.
It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
If he's reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. If not. We'll have to re-consider our options.
Well, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions. About us. About those bodies. About the gold. Seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
What the hell happened!
If money can buy what he wants.
You're late.
What's slow?
You mean, before she sank.
Headache, nausea, lights?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.
Murphy to Epps.
Greer?
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
The same day she supposedly went down.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Are we smart enough to avoid that?
Nope.
What do we do with him?
They went crazy.
We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one.
I know a little bit about human nature and what I've seen only confirms that.
Too deep to anchor out there.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Last thing I remember I was aboard the Chimera. Down somewhere in there scavenging around.
We're still drifting.
I thought you say Tuesday.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
You're kidding, right?
Guess.
Not the Maxine?
Hi.  Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
Was it Bosnia? I forget...  It's so sad, the tragedy of an entire country eloquently captured in the face of one little boy.  A Soul/Funk song starts up on the radio that catches her attention. She goes over and turns it up.
Seymour?... uh... hello... I guess I'm a little early...
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
So what do you think?
What do you mean?
Who, Doug? He spends more time here than I do...
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.
Forget it.
I just stopped in to say hi.
When did I say I hated you?
Why?
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
Much later.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
So what should we do?
Which loser?
Look, maybe that's him!
Just promise you'll do it.
It's always closed...
There he is...
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
What was that all about?
Ew ... when did you get that?
How about this?
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
Give me all your money, bitch!
Which one?
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Fuck it. Everything must go!
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
What are you talking about? Who?
Do you want anything?
Seymour does.
Tell me what?
You never paid me for that tape with the Indian dance routine.
Do you have any old Indian records?
Indian records?
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
You're right about that.  So this is your record collection?
Oh, right...
What about her? Would you go out with her?
I don't think so...
Relax, Seymour, relax...
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
Hey, can I borrow this?
Oh... uh... It's just this elastic thing I have to wear for lumbar support...
What, like a girdle?
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
No... no, it's just that I should get going in a few minutes, and --
...I better not...
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
Dana bought it when we went antique shopping. She said it didn't go with her stuff, so she gave it to me... she thought it fit in better with my "old time thingamajigs."
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I dunno, I...
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Well, here's where the fun never stops!
Yeah, I'm really, really happy. Really having a good time.
I am.
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
I don't know.
Why? What did she tell you?
Really, I don't know enough about it to...
That slut!
Seymour?
No hints, Samuel.
I didn't conceive of it for the lions- I built one in India when there was trouble with a tiger.
Don't much like them.
Every time I see something like that, I know we're right to be here- to bring Christianity into their lives, enrich their souls.
I'd love the company. And I've hunted all my life.
What?
...one shot...
In your honor, Nigel. And you and Singh will be in charge of building them- and you'll also build the roadbeds and the three foundation pillars- and you'll be finished in eight thrilling weeks.
All right- let's go into battle.  I'm Redbeard. 
I'll have to.
How many do you think they've killed?
Nonsense.
Thank you, Samuel.
Do you love her?
Where do you go next?
What do you want with my baby?
No harm will come to the child.  You might even say it's a privilege.  He will be the vessel for the spirit of Vigo.  And you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  Doesn't that sound nice?
Do you ever see him?
Egon, I'd rather you didn't mention any of this to Peter if you don't mind.
I won't.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
There's no doubt about it.  He's got his father's looks.  The kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  And smelly.  You stink!  It's just horrible.  You are the stinkiest baby I ever smelled.  What's his name?
No, I just got in -- a couple hours ago. Come on in.  Are we having a pajama party?
Peter, what about the bathtub?
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
That's not true.  It was 1620.
No problem.  Always glad to help -- and hug.
Should we go?
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
Then why have you come?
Command me, lord.
I command you.
They're the Scoleri Brothers.  I tried them for murder.  They were electrocuted up at Ossining in '48.  Now they want to kill me.
Like what?
Yeah, I had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  Forget it, Louis.  I could get in a lot of trouble.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
It's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
No, not exactly a man of the people.  "Also known as Vigo the Cruel, Vigo the Torturer, Vigo the Despised, and Vigo the Unholy."
There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red.
Is the line sinking?
Who?
Who?  Who?  Who?
Careful, Winston.  He's a mean one.  And to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'Welcome Back' service plan.
We're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
Well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
You got a flux and a half.
Huh?  What?
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
Ray -- Ray -- How do you feel, man?
Right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
Hi, Louis.
Oh, that's nice, Louis.  I'll stop by if I'm around.
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
No?  What do I act like?
Like a used car salesman.
That's it.  Get out.
Out!
Okay.  Then I'll go.
Yes, but I have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Really!  Is it gone?
No, we're moving you OFF CAMPUS.  The Board of Regents has decided to terminate your grant.  You are to vacate these premises immediately.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
I think it's the food of the future.
I don't believe in luck.
And would this storage facility be located on these premises?
No, you may not.
And why not, Mr. Venkman?
Why do you want to see it?
Two wavy lines?
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
What have you got, Egon?
Does she want to be?
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Of course!  Ivo Shandor,  I saw his name in Tobin's SPIRIT GUIDE.  He started a secret society in 1920.
Ray, as your friend I have to tell you I think you've really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  You've been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the Five Boroughs who thinks he's had an experience.  And what have you seen?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Do you think it's wide enough?  How much?
How was your date?
Are you a Christian, Ray?
Me, too.
Yeah, Judgement Day.
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
Tell Lykas to send a retiarius and a Samnite to help Tiger.
Lykas, pick a man.  Someone who will look good.  Jerses I want it built up in the Daily Action...
Caesar?
Throw it down into the streets! Down into the Forum.  If it's my father they want then give him to them!
Yes.  You know, that's not a bad idea.
So am I.
Sacks of grain, even bread.  I own the grain licenses for the military, I can arrange to divert a shipment bound for the army of the Danube.
Caesar, let me sponsor your first wager in the arena.
Underdog!  How can he be an underdog -- he wins all the time!  I'm the emperor why can't I kill him?  He could be poisoned, or somehow killed to look like an accident.
This is Cos, this precocious young man.  A scribe for the Daily Action.  I've invited him to write a small piece about you...
I don't know...
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
God of passages and changes?
I've read of it.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
Why you?
Why do you keep playing at being so humble?  It's a little embarrassing.
Why do you play at being drunk?
He killed his father and then my family...
If I'd ever had a sign that you wanted to rule I would have... no, again, it's my own bullheadedness. Narcissus, I should have adopted you years ago.  And now the Gods are begging me to make you my son!
So I understand.
You're too hard on him.  He is a strong young man, with you as his guide...
A man should be upright, not be kept upright.  History shows us that a good general is quick to recognize opportunities -- even if it means making a complete about face at the last minute.  I want you to consider becoming my heir.
I was summoned.
You seem to be doing a great job of it single-hand!  Narcissus, the Republic is dead.  You think those Senators could govern?  For the last hundred and fifty years they've worked hard at kissing an endless succession of Imperial asses!
What about their philosophy lessons?
You need to come home!
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
Narcissus!
I'll never die.  You tell the girls that.  You honor our ancestors and I'll be there.  Every night.  At the table of life.
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I killed too many barbarians.
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
General, hang on... drink slowly. You are blessed by the Gods to have a physician and a Divine of Janus with you tonight.  A fan sent them to you.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
You get to come alive again in the country!
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
How much money is involved?
Let's talk about this later.  Right now we have other things to settle. You and your family will be leaving with a supply ship returning in the morning to Ostia.  From there, Caesar has decreed you be given an estate in Paestum.  It's beautiful; an old Greek town right on the ocean.  Rich soil.  Perhaps we could keep our financial arrangements... although Caesar will give you a sort of pension it's always good to look to the future, keep your hand in the arena... so to speak.
No.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
And it's all over now.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
I said I think it is.
Why?
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for.  What's this?  It's from my grandmother.
The marble?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
Yes.
I just don't think it would work.
Why do you have to see him?
No, Benjamin.
Hello -- who is this?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Excuse me.  Mr. McQuire.
Are you listening?
Yes I am.
I'd rather not.
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
Did you get a room?
Is anything wrong, sir?
Oh no.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Drink?
Yes.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Look -- I think I should be going --
No.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
What?
Well I don't know.
I think I'll go to bed.
What if he did?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
What?
I want to say something first.
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes?
This is all terribly wrong.
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
What one.
There!
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
How do you get out of the house?
The driveway's on my side of the house.
About five years.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Well how do you feel about him, then?
I don't.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Well how did it happen?
There's nothing to tell.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
But it's not.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Why did you say that?
I do.
I do.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Oh no.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
But why?
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Turn 'em up.
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
No.
I'll pay you back.
How?
Dictation.  You know...
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
What?
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Chasing what?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
Why?
Going?
Yes -- oh!
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
How tired you are!
Yes -- tired...
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
There.
I don't want them now.
Do you understand?
Very early in the morning.
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
On the train?
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
General Director Preysing!  Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
Then you know him?
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
I've no luck.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
It's always so quiet here.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
This gentleman can have my room.
Oh!
Send his bags up to my room.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
The Grand Hotel.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.  And these are real silk drapes.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
You're trembling.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
What?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
What...! --
You...
No.
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
No -- now.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
What we want to know about is Manchester.
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
...and let me say again for the tenth time...  ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Every seat for the opening has been sold at Vienna. Sold out for three days.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Again?
-- We must do something...
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
We will wait.
How is the house?
Terrible. After this, no more ballets for me. Jazz --  Just jazz.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
No.
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
Roy? He's always crying.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
We have to be ready. We have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
You are a valued customer, as you know.
All right.
Well, I'd have to see it, of course.
Well, uh... No.
No?
I take care of the being-fair-to-me department. Things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
So what's your story today?
They twisted my arm.
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I pay my debts.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
Just a few bucks.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
I know you do, so that's why --
Oh? I didn't know anything was.
Well, uh...
Well, it doesn't matter, does it? I'm getting out.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?
You heard the shower, didn't you?
I didn't teach you that.
Where's the five?
You called the doctor, huh?
I don't see why we have to take the train.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
What happened to Cole?
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
Regret what? I didn't say I was coming aboard.
The last I looked, we were just talking things over.
What is it? What's going on?
My mother... Well, I guess it doesn't matter now. She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some day.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
What?
Ate the gun. Oh.
That's that, then.
That's true, Mr. Simms.
Well, when you put it that way.
I can be real stiff.
Carter.
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
Well, Dad thinks it's okay.
Forget it.
Wrong.  There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
Yes.
Where's Molly?  She's not in her room...
You stole it?
I came to see you.
You okay?  You seem a little off.
It's John, isn't it?
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate.  It was once Laurie Strode.
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  It's the truth.
Yeah.
Can't you hold it?
You aced it, didn't you?
What's this?
Better her than me.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Why?  You interested?
Mom -- Who is this?
Aren't you gonna answer that?
Promise?
He told me about the terrible things that happened here.  In our house.
What in God's name are you talking about, woman?  When are you gonna stop listening to those damned talk shows?
I've been knocking.  The door was open. Is everything all right in here?
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
Any word on the location of the Strodes?
Where's the child?
It was you.
Why did you take Jamie?
You've created a monster.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
Home is important to a man.
I didn't tell you everything.
I didn't even scratch the surface. You're lucky, boy.  You come home, and nobody's here.  When I go home, everybody's going to be there.
The hell with the diamonds!
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
What'll you do for transportation?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
One of them is the doctor, whose weapons are compassion, unselfishness, peacefulness-- maudlin concern.
Huh.
Alice would be absolutely tear-ass.
When I was a naive young recruit in Spain, I used to wonder why soldiers bayoneted oil paintings, shot the noses off of statues and defecated into grand pianos.  I now understand: It was to teach civilians the deepest sort of respect for men in uniform-- uncontrollable fear.  To our women.
The world is teeming with women-- ours to enjoy.
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
I dunno.
Hi, Penelope.
They were enemies.  We were at war.
I'd rather go to Viet Nam.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
Is anybody besides you here now?
She went to the fight with Herb Shuttle, I guess.
I see.  And he came into the apartment one day, to demonstrate his wares, and your mother, as it happened, was charmingly en deshabille--
College?
What a pity!  Educating a beautiful woman is like pouring honey into a fine Swiss watch.  Everything stops.  And the doctor?  He worships your father, too?
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
Mhravitch.
We came up behind a sentry, and your father slit his throat before he could utter a sound.
Uck.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
That's nice.  You thank her for me. Go to bed and get lots of sleep, and then you thank her in the morning.
Yes sir.  If you can't wake Mom up, I've got double-decker bunks.
A hundred dollars!
Dad--
How do you do.  My name is Penelope Ryan.  This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
"Hamburger Heaven."
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
You don't even know me.
What's the matter?
Like hugging a lamp post.
We thought a doctor might help.
Paul said you were awfully sick.
He doesn't deserve this!  You don't know him.  It isn't fair!
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
Chow, chow, chow!  God damn it-- nutriment!
And they have very mixed feelings about women.  They hate them in a way.  One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently.  They can scrog them, as you say--  for revenge.
You learned this in some college course?
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
Yes.
And no one's there now?
If he wants to go.
It's a big and busy funeral home.
I'm dying to hear of his reaction. The thrill of smashing something isn't in the smashing, but in the owner's reactions.
He feels awful loss--which was precisely my intention.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
If he thinks he's man enough.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
Are you've seen it work cures?
What for?
This little corpse is intended as a lesson?
Oooooo.  That hurt.
I'm high as a kite.
Cut me open.  Find out.
I've struck my blow.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Thank you--for my life.
Leave the rifle here.
I dunno, boy.
She did?
For saying "shit." Or is that okay now?
What happened?
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
Don't!
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
Thank you, kind sir.
Not true.
You know she has no feet!  You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
I was afraid to ask.
Is Norbert still here?
Father's friend.
Don't know.
Mom?
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
He is my father.
He'd kill me.  He'd be right to kill me, too--the kind of guy he is.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
What's the matter now?
Marry me instead.
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
This is very good for us.
The wilder Paul is tonight, the calmer he'll be tomorrow.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Is that a fact?
If he'd just get into scouting, and camp out some, and see how everybody roughhouses around the fire--
Walt Disney, who gave us Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, plays shuffleboard.  Jesus Christ plays shuffleboard.
Hello. My name is Beatrice. Have you been here before?
I don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
What do you mean, not the type? Don't you know who I am? I'm Big Dick Brown! I've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I've worked with Harry Reems. I've worked with Johnny Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brown. I'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, I've got nothing for you. If something comes up, we'll give you a call.
Apparently your friend has gone into Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?
I just want to ask some questions.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
No, I don't.
Are you going to stiff me?
I said I just wanted to talk to you...
'Film Producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Overpowering?
No.
I'm making a film. Jim Sullivan's going to be in it. He said you might know where Tod is.
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto.  Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
T stands for Total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'All my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.'
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
What makes you so sure?
Granville?
Look, Niki, this really isn't my business. I don't know anything about...
But then you'll forget about me.
Who's paying you?
You are.
As I was saying, I'll pick up the thread. There's a number of ways I can go. There's not much you can do here. Stay if you want. Maybe it'd be better if you went back home. Go through Kristen's personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. You could hire cheaper.
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
Do the police want to arrest me?
Yeah, sure.
Jake?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by some college kids.
No.
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Well...
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.
What?
This is from the movie I was talking about.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
Here. Take your fifty cents back.
That's all right.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
What's that?
I'm staking out this beer bottle. Trying to find out if I'll finish it or it'll finish me.
I also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Lady, you were going 70 miles an hour in a 45-mile zone. Could I see your license, please?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
Isn't this your vehicle?
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Oh. It looks like a hearse.  Very nice. Compact.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Yearse!
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
It goes on and on.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Over there by the courthouse.
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
Look, the ice is melting.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
It's so blue.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
No. I'd feel stupid.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
How about some candy floss?
I took them out.
Why?
But why now?
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Mother.
Love? Love? What do you <u>know</u> about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
Is Sunshine your real name?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
You liked your teachers?
Jeez! That's a great story,
You think so, sir?
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
Another man's life in your sights.
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Well, I didn't.
Frank.
He... he loved me.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Surreal? Strange? Nightmarish?
What?
Get out of the way.
WHY?
Then why are you here?
What are you talking about? Who are you?
Who?
They were over here, Professor.
Liz left us, Red. Take the hint.
Would'ya look at this babies? Made 'em myself. Holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
Touched you five seconds. Laid three eggs.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
How hard can it be? I punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
How many buildings does she have to burn? She belongs here!
Where am I -- exactly, Sir?
As you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
At nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. B&E. Robbery. Six guards dead --
Grounded? Who's grounded?
He gets fed six times a day. He's got a thing for cats. You'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. He never goes out unsupervised --
I sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. I ushered you into this world.  I alone know your true calling, your true name.
"One falls, two shall arise." So: you pop one, two come out. You kill two, you get four. You kill four, you're in trouble. We have to nail 'em all at once. And the eggs.
Those things never work. Never.
You'd better stay here. I'll find a way out. We'll come back for you.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
What are you, a Boy Scout?
"Need" is a good, solid word.
A brute.
What's happening?
Just in time.
Please. Get back into bed.
I have to speak to my father.
You remember.
Oh.  Oh yes.
Wedded bliss?
You're hurting.
This is what began it.
That's probably her now. Or the police.
I saw everything.
It's ONE of these.
Why didn't he want to sell it?
Not exactly modern.
Where are you?
What have you done?
Just a moment. Put on some music will you babe?
I don't know where to begin...
Just soda.
So, what's your problem? Let's get to it.  You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
Do you care ?
You wouldn't believe me.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
Where are you?
Kirsty.
What are you drinking, love?
PLEASE. You're in danger.
You know I do know the way home.
What's next?
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
He offended me with his terrible taste.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
What the fuck is that?
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that.  Over the edge, in fact.
Great.  Can I have it then?
Hey, Barry.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young.  You don't.  You don't look old either.  You look just as old as you are.  A bit younger maybe, but not a lot.  Not much.  Just right.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club.  It's a country-rock ballad.  Everybody'd go home.
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that.  They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
What's this?
I understand, Dick.
Well we rang $900 today.
Can I do anything?
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Hi.
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
Did you say something?
Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
You won't like it.
Of course it is.
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
Have you slept with him yet?
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
Hello.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I can't talk right now.
Don't worry about it.  Just get into bed.  Worry about that when you're better.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
Hi.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
What about Ian?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
Barry?  Barry knows about this?
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
I know.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
Actually, I'm fine.  I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what?  Maybe it is time to move on.  Maybe we're just not right for each other.  Or maybe we are.  But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
It's true!
Only because it's never the time.  I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Don't you like that?
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Oh, right.  Alright.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
I'll call you.
What do you mean?  Where did she go?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
I knew this was going to happen.
Seventy-five.
Naw.  Those are for us.
I'm Vince.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
How old is Richard?
Don't know about any of that. Suppose nobody does.
Do you play?
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
Grave robbers?
No one knows you're here?
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
You're using your son's name.
A factor of age.
Hardly a reason to run off with a murderer.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
Sometimes innocents become involved.
Come here, Brenna.
What is it like?  Being you?
Four?
All fashionably without heads.
What makes you so sure he's the one?
Hang on a sec, you did your little favor for the boys downtown, I'm sure your uncle and the rest are perfectly capable of taking it from here.
-Et lux perpetua-
Aye.
Why are you here?
You're a long way from Inverness.
You are still so very young.
What?
Why does he want to kill me?
But we cannot be killed.
Harder.  Concentrate harder.
Me arm hurts.
Go to hell.
And what is this great gift that cannot be seen or smelt?
But why be so concerned about me?
That is not me.
I'm your future husband, remember?
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Something pretty.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Far away.
Not so scared.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Our common heritage.  I am your only real friend, you know.  The only one who truly understands you.  I look forward to the day we meet again.  And I kill you.
Excuse me, "sir".  I thought we spoke as equals.
Equals?
Ah, Conor, how you look a man.
But Ian, he's still but a boy.
Where did you learn that?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
Spare a chair?
Kahn?
How are you?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
Leave her out of this.
Are you here?
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
Two days ago a Bulgarian national was murdered the same way.  He'd also been in the country less than a week.  What is your citizenship?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
A mystery.
I only just heard of Conor.  I came up from Catroch as soon as I could.
Morning Mr. North
Same.
Such a pretty day.  If I live to be 90 I'll never tire of mornings like this.  Mind you I'm 74 now.
The Sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Hildy!
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
How's business, Bruce?
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
The money? Why?
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Hello, Hildy!
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Say, could I meet him?
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
We're not interested.
She jumped out of the window.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
Hildy!
Huh!
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around here.
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
There's money in it, Cooley.
They're always after me for interviews.
Me, too.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
Hold the phone!
We know what you're up to.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
Just a minute, Johnson!
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
Where'd you get this?
That's murder!
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
For who?
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
Now, Hildy --
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
You'll take fifty and like it!
Where's the old lady?
I'm telling you. Can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! They come rollin' out like oranges!
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
There goes another scrub lady.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
Hello, Mr. Burns. Yes, she's still here.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Did you get that, Hildy?
Huh?
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
Isn't that her picture?
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
What good'll it do?
They got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Huh?
Who? Me?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
For heaven's sake, why not?
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Get the cops, somebody.
Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.  Come in, Dave Schwartz.
What's he want?
The door was locked.
Why?
What's that?
Would.
Who with?
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
We're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
Never done better. On the fiddle. Like everyone else.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
You always were, Clive. Steady the Buffs.
We all had to write a last letter home.
Has Sue got it right?
And what's that?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
When do you think you'll get leave again?
I can't do it. What's the point?
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
Father, that's enough now
What did I do to deserve this?
You married that fool, Clive, that's what. Never mind, you can stay with us.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
Really, wow, so it's really a real thing.
I always hate saying the word cheese, every time you get your picture taken... smile, say cheese.
Oh, I know. I'll show you where it's at, sweetie. Aren't you just so cute all bundled up like a cinnamon roll of Christmas love.
I guess I'll try to back it out on the rim... at least to the main road.
Don't worry, sugar. It ain't past my bedtime... are you flirting with me?
I'd like to see that.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
There always one kid with no bodily controls. We had this dude, Jeff Baxter, he was a puker. The fucker would just sit there puke all over himself.
Yeah, no shit I just told ya.  Hey, you think this place called Alien Ed's UFO Welcoming Center is still around? It says, "Where the Fact is separated from the Fantasy."
Holy crap. You gotta see this place. It's awesome.
How much further?
What was that?
Yeah, I fixed it. Well, I ain't... um, I can't remember. I think I took it out to fit the bags and forgot to put it back.
Don't forget the flashlight, it's pretty dark out there.
We'll need pictures of the inside too.
Forget it. I'll just go.
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Well, yeah... I think that if you knew him... I mean if you'd understand his urges, shit the guy's like forty or something.
No, he's just joking. We don't really have any plans other than spending the night at my Dad's house...  ...which is where we were headed when our car broke down.
Thank you.
Hey, I'm just waiting for Cousin Itt to show up.
Someone is out there...  ...help, we're in here!
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Sleeping.
No please, let me sit this one out.
Never. I swear to God he never sleeps, he goes to bed after me, wakes up before me. He's always working on 10.
I don't hear anything.
Jesus Christ.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?
A couple hours!
Don't be such a fucking smart ass.
Yeah, no mercy here.
That's the understatement of the year.
Hey, maybe the guy with the tow truck could drive us to a phone.
What do they call you, sweety?
So, what brings you kids way out here, ain't you got something better to do for Halloween than wander around out here in the sticks?
Maybe. He's a real lady killer.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Where's Bill?
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Questions? Well, heck, I'll tell you anything you want to know.
Grampa... watch the language.
Yeah, I hear it... where's it coming from?
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.
Plates match.
Yeah it's horseshit, just some boogieman crap that the kids like to scare each other with.
That is the wrong fork, young man.  Harold, tell the boy.
Oui.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Yes. Happy happy.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I am sleepy.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
Stop. Get away.
Well, I think...
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
You still in the market for a real boy?
I don't get that. Is that sexual?
Shut up and tell me.
Loves animals. Loves you.
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
My brother is discreet.
One night stand?
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
Please, honey, let me in.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
You've got to respect that.
Where?
Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
Boy, this is good!
Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible.
What are you doing in there?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
Shaving cream?
What?
What?
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
What are you doing in there?
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Of course not.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Sure. Of course.
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
That's great.
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up.
Should I come with?
Shit.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
I bow to your expertise in these matters.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something.
Mm hmm.
Give me a bottle of beer.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
All I want's the money.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
That seems a shame. The night is young.
How much do I owe you?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
Now, when did you adopt me?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Man named Turk Baker?
You know everybody, don't you?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
How do we stand?
I'll beat him the next game.
How're the hands?
I wanna walk.
I got time, Bert.
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
The expensive kind.
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
Fast and loose, man.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
You don't need a drink.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
Go to hell.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
Yeah, yeah, like a son.  I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
Oh yeah? Where?
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Findley.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
How much?
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
How much you playin' for?
Long wait for a bus?
Do you always ask so many questions?
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Where you been all day?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
No, why should I? It's yours.
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
He's a gambler.
Is he a winner?
Well, he owns things.
What do you want to tell me?
A week? A year?
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
Game's over, Eddie.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.
You lived like this once.
With them?
I don't know.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?
Only got one kind.
We're going to be moving, son.
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
... and Rigel.
What did it look like?
Where's your car?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
Damn.
Don't go in.
Mom -- this is the best show all year.
I wish I could do more but we're moving out.
We're going with you. I mean, we're going too.
Connie, don't hang up.
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
He's a good man.
I'm only saying, it's been what? Four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
Pops!
You want to borrow the car? You don't have a license.
They don't know this.
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
Dad, please...
Thanks, Pops.
Oh shit, we're late.
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
It had been deemed classified.
With their shields down it might be possible.
A meteor?
No Sir. Definitely not.
How do you know?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
It's doing what?
Wait. I have to tell you something.
Be careful.
You're late.
You scared the hell out of me.
Dick-weed.
Your son.
Don't get premature on me, Jimmy. We don't light up 'til the Fat Lady sings.
I shouldn't have left her.
But I gave you some this morning.
I spoke with the Joint Chief when they arrived at NORAD. They agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. Hit 'em with everything we've got.
And before here?
Many worlds...
Peace? No peace.
Yes.
Your treat.
Marcus -- I've seen this window before.
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
What about you?
What?
Look what you did!
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
I maintain an apartment in Venice, at your disposal.
This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.
Where did this come from?
The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
What's that?
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
Don't wander off.
Uh-huh.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
How did you get here?
Don't call me that, please.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
They want my diary.
How did you she was a Nazi?
Marcus would agree with me.
We didn't talk. We never talked.
Well... I can't think of anything.
I know, Dad!
This is intolerable!
Penitent. Penitent...
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
What did you find, Junior?
Who are you?
I don't need camels.
What?
Who?
Hard to believe, isn't it...?
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
I suppose stories of the Thuggees die hard.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Indy?
There were five stones in the beginning. Over the centuries they were dispersed by wars, sold off by thieves like you...
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
Nobody can say you don't have a vivid imagination.
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
The evil starts in Pankot. Then like monsoon, it moves darkness over all country.
You don't look very good.
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
What'd he say now?
Hey, Willie -- I think you better get out now.
Don't let it pull you deeper!
Can you move your arm?
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
Oh -- my -- god -- it's going to crush me!
Shorty's family was killed when they bombed Shanghai. He was living on the streets.
I'd like to find one of those myself.
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner.
What?!
I'm going down.
Indy? Did you talk to them?
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.
Who was it?
Yes?
What is your name?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
My place, can't you see?
You've heard of the PEM114...
I just went there for a job.
What are you doing?
Kill myself.
Hear voices don't I.
You weren't listening!
Why not?
Anyone there?
Behind us?
Calm Down! Act rational.
I did. I brought you back here.
They'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
Sue them.
Which way do I go?
Take a left and your next right.
They think we're safe here. They don't really need us. They're probably long gone.
What do we do?
You'll be me.
Eating sushi?
Now what?
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.
What was?
Touch her.
What?
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Now, where would I be?
It is my business. It's my name.
What did that cost?
You're not just after this girl, are you?
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
My coast is Maine, actually. We have a place in Bar Harbor...And a bar in Sutton Place.
They're all in it.
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
And on my time.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Osaka.
On what?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
Just stay here and rest.
Where are you going?
What?
Not sure at all.
Do it.
Are you alright?
Do something.
What exactly?
I was wrong. She tried to help us get away.
She is beautiful.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
In a way, we're like brothers... I can't have her. I want you to.
JOE       Go to, What the Hell does that mean?!!
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.
Doesn't matter.
Oh, I can't.
What happened?
In him?
Private clinic. Best of care. Total privacy. We'll pay all costs.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
It's just money.
Yes?
That name's familiar.
What?
Who...are you?
How do I look?
Well...
Well what?
Oh....Sure.
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Not...complaining, actually.
I said...I didn't say..anything!
...Blake
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
As if your mind's not all there.
Promise you what?
You're talking to me.
And how'm I doing?
...Naw. Made that up.
Hires you for what?
And you, what do you like?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
Last night?
No.
Food doesn't agree with me.
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
We're very close.
One chip?
How do you know you can trust me?
What is it?
What?
Now what?
You've  been there?
They asked about you.
Why did you, then?
Now what?
Now what?
Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
Yeah...I have to get away.
That's alright. Just tear it apart.
It doesn't hurt.
What does he know?
Hey, baby. What's wrong?
We'll give you a heads up before we launch.
How long?
Sure. Where?
What? Forget it.
Suein Hwang and Milo Geyelin.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
Oh, we need cops on the street. We don't need them on horses.
Alright, alright.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
There has been so much soul searching about this Wigand, I've decided we should cut an alternate version of the show without his interview.
You think I put that bullet in the mailbox myself...?
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
Hi, baby.
Yeah?
You're sure you want to do this?
...taping?  What are you taping?
I'm doing an interview.
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye. 
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
What?!
I'm alone on this...
Get some perspective, Lowell.
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Alright.
Well, I'm working with someone, now, who was the former head of research at Brown & Williamson, a former corporate officer there.
What's your interest in this, Mr. Bergman?
It would be better if he called us.
Alright?
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Thank you for saying that...
Did I get you up?
No, you give me a break! I never left a source hung out to dry, ever. Abandoned. Not 'til right fucking now! When I came on this job, I came with my word intact. I'm gonna leave with my word intact. Fuck the rules of the game! Hell, you're supposed to know me, Mike. What the hell did you expect? You expect me to lie down? Back off? What, get over it?
Coffee?
How have you liked your stay?
Look, I really don't have that much time...
Is there anything you want to know about me, Mr. Wigand...?
What do...
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
And I don't like paranoid accusations! I'm a journalist. Think. Use your head. How do I operate as a journalist by screwing the people who could provide me with information before they provided me with it?
Talk to me outside the zone of your agreement?
Like what?
How'd you know that, Lowell?
Yes.
Jeff...
Lowell, I can't afford --
"Up to you, Jeffrey. That's the power you have, Jeffrey. Vital insider information the American public need to know." Lowell Bergman, the hot show who never met a source he couldn't turn around.
We have a couple. One's hers, one's mine. Everybody uses a different name.  Modern marriage.  How's Liane?
Right.
Object to the form!
Hello.
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
Well, I wouldn't say --
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Is that... one person?
Triple!
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
Oh. That.  Don't waste time with your queen.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
What is it you're after, Miles?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Hello?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
Hmmm...
And here I thought my mother was...
We're damaged goods.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
You do?
Do you want to sleep on it?
Fabric and fringe.
I have a surprise for you.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
Marylin!
Forgery? Fraud?
Pre-Castro.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
So what?
Sam is Sam. He's taking up fly fishing. He's in a yert in Montana.
My client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
She's YOUR wife. Why don't you ask her? Anyway, I assume she signed the highly over rated Massey pre-nup.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
Mm.
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
I don't know. I can assume...
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
I think that went as well as could be expected.
She always looked out for me.
Nothing.
I am very sorry.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Wrigley?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Let me tell you something about Patty.
Who's "Patty."
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
George was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts.  She's my idea of nothing!
South America.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scareIwhen I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Are you going to see him?
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
What about that diamond wrist watch she had onshe can raise some money on that?
But it's King Westley on the phone.
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Whadda you want!
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
Yeah?
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. 
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
That's right. You didn't.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Who are you?
Outside!
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get toughwe can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
I better go over and see her.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
That's silly.
What're you going to do?
What for?
Why not? I'm hungry.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
What about money?
Me?
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
ONETWOTHREEFOURFIVE
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Not interested. 
In about fifteen minutes.
You made no mistake sitting next to me.  Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about.  Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck.  What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
Oh, by the waywhat's your name?
I've been thinking about you.
The dame's too smart for him.
Yeah? Where?
Mr. Gordon
Don't "Joe" me.
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
Listen, manI'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof"
Why?
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
William Walter, the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office, gave me a copy of this.  It went all over the country.  Nothing was done, and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this wasn't even mentioned in the Warren Report!  Read it, Al.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
Well, the kid musta gone nuts, right?  I said Oswald must've flipped.  Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him, right?
Who the hell opened my files!  You've been looking through my private files, haven't you, you weasel?
Who?
Or a cover up!  Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
Correct me if I'm wrong.  I thought we were on the same side.  What the hell business is it of theirs to say that?
Keep saying what?
Go on, Willie.
I'm lost, boss.  What are we saying here?
All right, all right.  Break it up.
I don't buy it, chief - why would the FBI cover it up?  You're talking the whole FBI here.  A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country?
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Julius Caesar:  "Brutus and Cassius, they too are honorable men."  Who killed Caesar?  Twenty, twenty-five Senators.  All it takes is one Judas, Bill - a few people, on the inside, Pentagon, CIA...
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
It leads farther than that.
That cocksuckin' faggot!  He's got me by the balls.
Do you mind if I smoke, Mr. Garrison?
Yeah, now that's true.  I drove to Houston.
Dave, may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory?
And then Sunday?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
No.
Well, it looks like it, Jasper.
So off the record, he starts talking about my family, and even mentioned my marriage was in trouble like I didn't know it or something.  He got angrier and angrier and then:
Four to six.
...which is strange 'cause this is less than 20 minutes after the assassination.
No.
David Ferrie.
Please answer the question.
Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this.
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
I want to thank you, Mr. O'Keefe, for this time.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Post Office.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
When Kennedy gets to the kill zone, it's a turkey shoot.
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
I thought the FBI test-fired the rifle to make sure it could be done?
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
He's done it before.  Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro.  No big deal.  In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket.  Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams.  Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop?  Part of the scenery.  The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
If you buy what you read in the paper.
You have other information?
Sure.  'Course they hated the sonofabitch, but...
The assassination, Jack?
Hate mail here.  Fan mail here.  The bad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office.
Less than you would guess.  Most days two to three assistant D.A.'s. A handful of police investigators.
I propose you accept an appointment to the bench in Federal District Court and move into a job worthy of your talent.  Do you have any idea, do you have any conception of how easily such an appointment can be arranged?
Virginia.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
I'll call her.
Won't forget?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
Naw, man. I gotta be someplace. I was kinda hopin you could come with me.
Man, I ain't ready to be goin' out nowhere --
Fuck that shit, man. I ain't shootin' anybody.
Why were you with him?
Great, you're here.
She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you.
I'm not a loser.
My pocketbook.
Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
What did they want to know?
Ordell pick up his bond?
Yeah, if I cooperate.
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
'74, I think.
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
Fifteen thousand.
What'd ya see?
Pretty good. Me and Annette Bening are goin steady.
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
They seem to like the idea.
Will Ordell go for that?
He was here?
I see.
What about you Max?
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
Set him up.
He's already there.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I'm fifty-five-years old. I can't blame anybody for anything I do.
We'll just be a minute.
You know what we want.
The envelope contains ten thousand dollars. The subject will be delivering the currency in a...
You two meet?
What did you say?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Well, this sounds like a lady I'd like to have a word with. So everything's set for tomorrow?
We could, if I'm not in jail.
It's possible. You're saying you don't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand?
You'd take a polygraph on it?
If it'll make you happy.
We were, and we lost him. He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out. The bar was on Ninth, less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead. It looks like Louis's friend shot him twice at point blank range.
So what happens now?
Oh, hi.
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
Dreaming.
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
How you doing, Ms. Jackie?
They asked.
You a fine lookin' woman, Jackie. I bet you do a damn sight better than okay. You think anybody followed you?
So we need two people, two women.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Plus the same deal as before.
Who?
Who's paging you?
Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Yeah.
No.
I don't like dancing.
I lived there for about nine months.
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
That's good money.
Then what?
Who was that?
Who was Beaumont?
An employee I had to let go.
I still don't understand why you keep her around.
Did you get it?
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
I haven't even looked at it yet, it's still in the shopping bag.
Twice. In the parking lot.
How long was she in there?
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Fuck you for asking me that.
That's why I never checked it. The bag felt right.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
Tell me.
How am I supposed to know that?
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Getting there.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
Yes.
What does she do for you?
Beaumont worked for you.
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.
How'd you find me?
That's what Winston does. He finds people who don't want to be found.
And you did that to protect my interest?
Call her, tell her the combination.
I know where it is.
Turn left.
Now, is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car?
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
I don't know. I don't know.  This isn't happening.
No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Grass never did that to me.
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?
Hello.
Jesus Christ! Who's been talking to you?  What's going on? How can you just turn away?  What about the others?
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
Ah! I thought you were a mailman.
I am.
Then why aren't you teaching? Why aren't you in a university?
I'm too messed up to teach.
You need ... a doctor.
Why do you say that?
If it was any other brain but yours, I might agree. Relax, this is going to be strong.
I had this weird flash just then.
Are you in the service?
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere. Tuscon was it?
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
I'm afraid, Prof. Nothing makes sense.  Please help me.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
Who did?
What happened to you?
Ready?
Jake!
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
You okay?
What do you mean? Where do you think?
Show me Della!
What does it say?
I can't do it.
Lie down!
Remember that.
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
I love you when you're angry.
Sit down.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
I don't know you.
You know goddamn well what I mean.
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
The Ladder?
And no more demons. I told you they'd be gone.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
I don't know what to say.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.
I'll page him.
Paul Gruneger!
They keep telling me I'm already dead, that they're gonna tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  I carry these everywhere but they don't help. Nothing helps. Everyone thinks I'm crazy. My mother filed a report with the army.
No one knows. They say it blew up.
On top of him?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
You got lucky.
Duck fuckers?
Goodbye old friend.
Can we blow it with just two?
Where the hell were you?!!
How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
Yllo, what's your head count?
wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo!
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing?
Rizzo, he's out there.
Rizzo?!
No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing!
Oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
No thank you, you crazy old woman.
That's really funny.
Now this is getting exciting.
You must shut down the engines.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
I'm surrounded by idiots.
Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
Who are you apologizing to?
Kay-Em, you okay?
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?
Leave him behind!
Then open the doors!
Now lay back we need to do some tests and I have some questions...
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
They can deal with this sort of thing.
More soldiers?
How do you open the damn door?
Yes!
You got it.
I know who he is...
How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
Look a' that -- Bayonet Iwo Jima.
He's busting the shaft! Start the pump!
He can't stay down with three barrels on him! Where is he?!
I used to wear this to the Garden. Garbage strikes. Dog shit. Muggers.  Ship it.
You going to be all right?
Larry, we can re-open the beaches in August.
I don't know if I can do that without a...
Maybe we can save August...
I was acting in the town's best interests...
...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. Torso severed in mid-thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. May I have a drink of water? Right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. Portions of denuded bone remaining.  -- did you notify the coast guard?
Florida license plate.
Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around?
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
He didn't have a dinghy aboard. I'm going down to take a look at his hull.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
I hope we get some more help.
What's that, a ship?
Christine what?
Think she might've run out on you?
You here for the summer?
I'd like to tell you what we're doing so far. These are some of the steps I've taken as Chief of Police...
You're leaving?
Yep.
I just wanted to know if you were all right... the Coast Guard let me use their radio. Is Chief Brody there?
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I've been to sea since I was 12. I've crewed three Trans-pacs --
I'm not talking about day sailing or pleasure boating. I'm talking about working for a living. Sharking.
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Anti-Shark cage.
I'll drink to your leg.
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
So that's cool with you, then?
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Leah just told me you were going with her.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Like I'd marry you! You would be the meanest wife of all time. And anyway, I know you weren't bored that day because there was a lot of stuff on TV. The Blair Witch Project was on Starz, and you were like, "Oh, I want to watch this, but we should make out instead. La la la."
Just like our moms and teachers!
No.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
Yeah.
Well, we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage. It cost me $800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed.
I mostly work from home. I'm a composer.
I wrote that.
It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.
The Wizard of Gore?
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Nothing. She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing.'
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Is Vanessa here?
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Can I take your coats?
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
There are ads? For parents?
You're not listening to me.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral? I don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
...I said, I like your hair.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
That's me.
No it is not!
Adele... are you serious?
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
Early, what're you doin'?
Oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? I'm the one got hit.
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Brian.
That's a good idea. Unfortunately most of them have been executed.
This guy killed a mess of people.
...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
Dahlia, no.
I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
That your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
Yeah?
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Up yours.
What is it?
What about you?
Not yet.
Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
What?
Right.
Yeah.
To what? Virgins?
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
You think he's got any herb?
You think?
Why?
Right. But when you deflower a girl, that's it. You did it. You were the one. No one else can ever do it.
You got any money?
Yeah. "The Wonder Twins". You know.  Activate in the form of, a glass of water.
Yeah.
Right.
I wanna fuck Darcy.
At that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
How are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? That shits gotta be against the law.
So. These people live on the same streets. It's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. The regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
I'll tell you why. Because when I was little, I had a fat cousin, cousin Luke. And he used to make fun of the handicapped. And one day he had a bad stomachache. So he drank a bottle of Pepto and his ass blew off.
You goin'?
What?
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
I was lookin' for you all day today.
You should come back with me to Steven's house.
Tonight?
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Telly is at Steven's?
Jennie. You've tested positive for the HIV infection.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
You are being ripped open.
I didn't bleed.
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Diss digg. I'm curious if you have it?
Yeah.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
It's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
By yourself?
What do you mean, no?
I wouldn't know.
No it wasn't.
What if he doesn't bite?  What if he's an exceptionally bright Raccoon?
No, I need the original note.
Then let's narrow it down.
What are you talking about?
What do you think?
The F.B.I. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  I think he's a first- timer.
What is it?
You should be an actor, Frank.  You looked like you were really mad.  The veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
Remember eventually revenge is carefully...  Have you tired juxtaposing the words?
To get your attention.
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?
Hello?
Huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
What?
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
Let me speak to my daughter.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
This isn't going to help, David. You're mother's dead.  You can't undo it.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
I admit I handled it badly.  Sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
They asked who would be best suited for this and you--
I just can't believe it.
Kathy, please.  You're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
Congratulations, dad.
That has nothing to do with it.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?
Six, eight hours tops.
But we heard him.
That would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  Power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  Once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  But, in all the research I've read on Serial Killers, I've never heard of one moving so fast. It's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
I don't think it matters.  Last nights victim, Christie Eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. The night before, Debi Rutlege was found in the center.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
I can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  Do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
It's a commercial area.  No one lives there.
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
We got a problem?
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
I've got be here for the police when they come.  Then I've got to practise. In case you forgot I'm in the middle of a match right now.
What do you see here?
Bainbridge Books.
Are you with the tournament?
Yes.
When I was very young.
Sounds very violent.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
What?
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
Why?
Because I know what it says.
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
Take off your clothes. I'm going to scrub you down.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
You must move away from the Center.
Move quickly. We are coming for you. We are in the Fortress.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
I have no extraordinary powers.
There is no other way.
Reach out farther. Call to her.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
I chose the wrong passage.
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
My <u>friend</u>.
You will follow me.
That I promise you.
You've eaten nothing.
The best. But my unhappiness is not made lighter by adding your's to it.
Subject to the King, no doubt.
I intend to keep you alive, your majesty. So you can abdicate your throne and become my Warlord.
You!
You do?
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
They'll trample him to death!
I do not want your worlds or your slaves.
It's a lie!
He will come for me.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
The attacks are unceasing: by night, the Dark Ones; by day, those of our people who have sold themselves to them, those traitors who are called the Slayers.
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
How many did you lose?
The new King.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
Yes.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
The most beautiful woman in the world.
Yeah... How do you know it?
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Good, what are you going to do? Do you come back?
...What?
Yeah.
OK, I'm fine.
How can you say it?
How do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... It may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... How can you know?
Not taken.
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
You're darkening the picture, aren't you?
I love you so much, Leon.
Well... I don't know, suddenly, the make up... All this... How are you?  Are you OK?
...No...
How many girlfriends did you have?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
Huh! You made an error, baby.  I don't know any Danielle.
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Huh? Why?
Messina.
Yeah, but I don't give a shit about.  I trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
This smells good.
Uncle Maurice, you're wearing sneakers?
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
Are you two planning kids?
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
Pardon?
I know what you're getting at.
I've seen it before.
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Okay.
You thought I sent them?
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
What it is -- is the truth.
No.
You like to take walks?
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Red flag, man.
Not our problem.
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
Yes.
She knew you loved her.
Why know?
Ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... Everyday. Now that's about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  And you know what Kris?
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
If that ain't fate?... Hi, I'm Dave Caldwell.  I do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
There's a one-drink minimum per show, I hope you saw the sign when you came in. Anyway, they're supposed to tell you.
What are my choices?
Coffee?
Hello.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
I sometimes fade out.
Do you want to fuck now?
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
How are you doing?
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
I don't understand any of that.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
What did they look like?
About ready for another drink?
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
Was there any evidence that Mrs. Windham shot him?
Is everything okay?
I think it's time discuss your career path. Have you thought about where you might be a summer associate?
So everything you just said --
What did you see when you entered the house?
I saw Mrs. Windham standing over the body of Mr. Windham.
We spend a beautiful night together and then I never hear from you again?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Licensed attorney or family member?
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
I know. He has it sent out.
Really?
I'm a bitch.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
I think you should go with red. It's the color of confidence.
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Don't ask.
Explain to me why you're so anti- Brooke.
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
Oh, my God! I completely forgot to tell you!
I got bangs!
I did?
Amazing how?
Class schedule, map, book list.
But what? We took the same LSAT, we take the same classes --
She's naked.
Aside from the fact that he found her on an infomercial? She said they humped like gorillas. Chutney could hear them all the way in the pool house.
Elle?
Is it a Kappa?
Helloo... you let him have anal sex with you.  Helloo... you let him videotape you diddling yourself.
Then we smash 'em?
You go to lady now?
Grotesque... monstrous...
You... you're a beast!
Like some vile toadstool.
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
Oh, yes...
What will become of me then?
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
You got no idee.  People there lookee diffelent; speakee diffelent. Nothing the same.  In my countlee I bling good luck.  Makee lain and thunder.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
You come stealee tleasoo?
And if I cannot?
What!
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all.  And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...?  If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Aye.  Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
Don't you know?
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
Course we care.  What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
What do I do?
Here now.  Toss her this when you've the chance.  Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass.  She's terribly vain.  Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
What is it?
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
Aye!  That too.
We must follow that bird.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Aye.  He's enchanted the lot of them.  His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Nice piece of work.
God's blessing.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Mean you to seek him out below?
Sunlight.
Can't we move any faster?
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
Tis not the wound, that's sure.  Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Nay.  It was lost.  When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
You see!  You see!
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
How're these?
Dolt!
Blackheart.  Aptly named.
A gentleman would offer water.
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
Are you honest?
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
Tis not fit for a princess.
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
In the dark... where I join him...
No!  Don't let go... you mustn't!  I love you!
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Ouch!  Something's biting me.
Biting you?
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir.  He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
Sigurd's sword...
What's this now?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Ask away, sweet man.
What became of the princess?
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
What can you steal from a man already lost his life?
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Oh.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Do you guys feel like painting?
Oh...I set it to see if it would work.
What are you doing up so early?
Can you keep Sam straight?
Did you feel anything?
It's not what I was expecting.
I wanted him to marry her.
I'm coming in.
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
I was wondering.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
Pardon me?
He buys and sells the world.
How old are you?
Thank you.
Sam?
Alyssa said you don't even have plumbing over there.
This has got to stop!
It'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  All we gotta do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  My dad's gonna let me use the boat and my charm is gonna let me use my rod.  Income village is the place to hook up with hump.
To check up on me?
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!
You don't have a choice.
Probably in the bible.
What are you doing?!
I'm leaving.
Well, until you know, you can't go.
You can't make me do a thing.
I'll have to pay him back.
I took some of your Vicodin.
How do you become something you're not?
What are you now?
I'm telling you now.
Why wouldn't she leave?
After everything he did to you and your mom?
She seemed upset.
I still don't know what that means.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
What kind of house?
Good for you.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I need you to do me a favor.
You should lock your doors.
He never answers.
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
Four days.  I left to think.
Kurt's been feeding him.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
Last time you were gone for a week!
No.  I was going to let you do that.
What have you been before today?
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
It's been a while.
I smiled at him.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
I need to know.
You got any weed?
What the fuck?
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
No.
I guess I could teach you some things.
Why?
Yes, it is.
A night in the hole?
She'll be fine. She just had a bit of a shock.
She's doing just fine.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
Oh, she's fine. She's just not coming today.
Want me to come back some other time?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
You're cute. You have any money, Claude?
That's some long green.
Nothing.
Well, maybe I should dig around in other people's clothes for money. It's obviously been highly successful for you.
How would I get a loan, anyway?
Thanks for backing me up here, Uncle Claude.
Yeah, I want some pie.
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.
Here I am.
What are you talking about?
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
What's up, Ray?
I said you're soft.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
That's right, we'll get off at the next stop. The train's pulling into the station right now.
The hell you talking about? What train?
Hell, yes, Yankee Stadium. Bombers are playing a double-header against the Red Sox.
I know people.
They must be the right people. Whoa, there goes the hot dog man. Let's get a couple. Damn, that smells good. Nothing like a ballpark hot dog, huh?
Him?
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
Let it go, Claude.
Crop duster.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
You sure it was him?
What'd you say?
What do you expect? It's almost as old as we are.
Next thing, you're gonna be complaining about the seats.
I know you're not talking to me...
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Where am I at, man?
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
Is everyone here?
You don't have to twist my arm.  Say now, that gumbo has quite a kick.
What's going on here?
I'm gonna work this man's brains out the back of his head.
Appreciate it.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
They'll be sending you up there soon enough. And not just for a visit, neither.
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Blacks welcome there?
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
What's that, some of your bathtub brew?
ADRIAN!
Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want it to end.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
My mom wasn't a goat?
An angel?
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
So far, so good. Now what?
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
What can I do about it?
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
Release the evil?
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
Now everybody sit down.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
Definitely.
How bad?
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
You got it. Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
His name is Andrew. I know that guy.
You sure you're down with this?
Looking for the chief.
My dad's an optometrist.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Don't do it.
It's like eighty degrees in this hallway. You from the South?
See something you like, my man?
You callin' me a thief, my man?
Are you too startled? Am I too removed from your ken?  I'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  No human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
That's better.  How do you want us?
All right. Now you keep your bargain.
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Why?
But you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "One for one. One for one."
Now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
No, Holly -- wait! He's running. Tell them the rest!
You prefer women?
Nobody. I felt sad... I put myself on the circuit.
About what?
I'm listening.
Six. I go red next year.
I know what everyone knows. Try like hell for Renewal. You have the same chance everyone else has.
It's different now. Help me.
I let him go... believe me.
Maybe you'll think of something...
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
I'm only telling you what I've heard...  Haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was Like...?
I have.
I don't remember exactly... except I was a Green.  What would you like to relive, Logan?
That's nothing... there's a Sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. Take me to them.
They won't believe us.
I'm afraid.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
I wanted to...  ...And you... what made you kill Sandmen?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
Look at his face... and his hair...  Is that what it is to grow old?
There's a Sanctuary... there is!
I'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
Is it inside the city?
Yes...
What people?
I'll make the arrangements.
Gracious... no.
What makes you think so?
To a city with thousands and thousands of people.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
I don't think so.
You want somethin'?
Yeah, I remember.
Hello.
Hello.
So, should I call Andy?
Okay...
You all right?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Sit down a minute.
Yeah? what did they want?
Never saw him before in my life.
Where's Pete?
Repeat that, Bill.
He's in the infirmary, being examined.
He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
Did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
What is it?
No, no I don't. Are you sure?
I told you to stay in the car!
Do they aim for the head or for the heart?
I'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
Pornos?
Mr. Eddy?
All of it?
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Any child knows how to tell direction. Any child. I don't care where the child is - in the air, on the earth, or in the sea. If you face the rising sun, your right hand is the north, and your left hand is the south
Will you stop squawking!
Thinking? What about some double solitaire?
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
Certainly not.
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
That's what I say. What do you say to a rubber of bridge? I saw some cards in the other room.
Cave, eh? Where?
There you are! Barnard, you'd better get your things together. We're leaving.
I see. You're afraid of going to jail, eh?
Who, for instance?
That's intelligent.
You have no disputes over women?
Suppose somebody wanted her so badly that he didn't give a hang if it was good manners or not?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.
Please let me help you.
I'm afraid that wouldn't help. You see, we have no porters here.
No porters here!!
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Splendid!
Are you so certain you are away from it?
How can we get in touch with them?
I'll die if I have to stay here another minute! I've waited a long time for this chance to go, and you're not going to stop me now. If I have to, I'll go alone. It was I who bribed the porters. If it weren't for me, you'd never get out!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
You're the man Chang told me about! You're the first - who - two hundred years ago  you're still alive, Father Perrault!
Colonel, wait a minute, they may be here now!  Say George, get down on that field and guide those planes in when they get here.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Do try to sleep, Bob.
What's it mean?
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
Oh, I'm feeling far too peaceful to be concerned about anything.  I think I'm going to like it here.
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
What do you mean if we should get out?
I'm afraid the porters are just a myth.  I guess we never will know why we're here, or how long we're going to be held prisoners.
What about the porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
So you think I'm mad?
Is that all my story meant to you?
Then you'd better go, George. This is no place for you.
It's that girl - that girl has twisted and turned
Besides, I - I don't feel like making that trip alone, Bob.
George, are you sure of the porters? About their taking care of you, I mean?
What's she got to do with it?
You're wrong, George.
The clothes?
Of course. We never left the air. I know - I didn't sleep the whole night long.
I don't know. He must have had some purpose in taking the plane away from Fenner.  When he lands, we'll find out.
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
I'm thirty.
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
You see, it's not a dream.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Well, everybody naturally wants to make a place for himself, accumulate a nest egg, and so on.
Perhaps.
The hell happened?
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
From now on, you'll respond only to the name "Jay." You'll dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the INS Special Services. You're not to stand out in any way.  Understand?
Look. I don't know why.  I could guess, however.  Maybe it's your attitude.  Or that you're not even close to a team player.  Or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
Cowan.  Do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
I think she's the alien.  In any case, she's clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.
If you don't have anyone to tell, you won't tell anyone.  Believe me, you get used to it.
what's this?
The radio show?
Kay.  All I'm saying--
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago...
What a coincidence, cause I was just thinking about you, too, Jack.  Recognize this?
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
I dunno. One?
We've got about eight or nine prospects	I want you look--
I know what this is.    Zed, you in?
Actually, yeah--
In about 10 seconds they're gonna start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
This it?
We need to talk to you about the alien.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
What about the other agents?  Ella? Tee?
Yeah?  What's up?
And I assume you're bringing this to us because we're the most powerful country on the planet...
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things. The first was what my son would look like if he were alive today. If I would even recognize him if I saw him on the street.  The second was what I would do to the man who took him.
Anderton --
The drowning woman.  Anne... But it was too late.  Her little girl was already gone.
You do understand I can't just give you new irises.  The scanners will read the scar tissue.  Alarms will go off.  Large men with guns will appear...
You set your patients on fire!
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
You the only sentry?
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.
Uh-huh...
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
She's worried about you.  And, quite frankly, so am I.
What if Danny Witwer came to you right now and insisted on a full chem run?
How could Witwer have accessed the case file?
I'm not getting halo'd.
People want to believe in the system.  That's the beauty of it...
No doubt the Precogs have already seen this.
No doubt.
What?
Jad.  How come you're not out there with Father Witwer?
Why did you catch that?
You're certain?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
I find it interesting that some people have begun to deify the precogs.
The precogs are pattern recognition filters, nothing more.
Flaws.
You gonna tell on me?
To you?  I don't think so...  What'd she say?
Wally, listen to me...
I like you, Wally, so I'm not gonna kick you, or hit you with anything, but only if you promise to help me...
Rufus, for Christ's sake, get up.
She's got information inside of her.  I need you to get it out.
C'mon, Rufus, you've been busted twice for felony hacking.
What happened?  Where's the rest?
The funny thing is, I started to believe he really was my Dad.
Let go of the gun.
The what?
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
How do I even know which one has it?
John?
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
It's the same prevision.
I know.  He came to me, told me about the missing data stream.  He was concerned that you might find it.
By fooling the system.  All someone would have to do is wait for Precrime to stop the murder from taking place, then, a few minutes later, commit the crime in exactly the same way.
Precog Deja Vu...
Anderton's smart enough to go where electronic billboards and other media can't ID him to pick his pocket.  There's fewer consumers down there, which means fewer scanners to target him.
No offense, sir, but why wouldn't he just run?
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
There a maid in this hotel?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
What kind of cop were you before this?
How many?
Who?
This your work?
We used to, every summer.
But John was with him at the pool?
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
He took out his gun and sat down to watch his home movies.  This is all in your statement, Lara...
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what?  You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
To prevent a murder.  Sooner or later, he's going to contact you.
What do you think?  So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing about it.
Yeah.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Is it a good room?
Women?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
I got news for you, Bobby, he don't give a shit.
You think he don't know? I give him his cut of seventeen hundred, I think he knows I can't make that lap dancing.
A elephant seal. Where's mommy?
What's wrong, baby?
Honey?
So, what kind of gig is this?
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Yeah? You sure?
Maxie's fucking with me. He put you with the spook to get under my skin.
Just so you know, I bought you out with Maxie. I suggest you leave while you can.
Dude, listen, man. I'm cool. How much for the treatment?
Draw.
5-5-1.
How bad is it?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Yeah?
He must have that shit troughed.
Quick drop. In and out.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Ricky? Ricky 'I lost the truck' Ricky?
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
He'll work it off.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Take a few days --
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Don't 'easy Ruiz' me. Y'all turned a Easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  Bring me four eggs Benedict and a mimosa. You all want mimosas?
Where's the drop?
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
So, Jimmy, you know where this address is?
Excuse me, we need to make a call.
It's important.
Ruiz is always on the list. He just ain't here, though.
Can you check?
Sorry, man, but...
What about boxing?
What are you saying?
So?
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I got no idea.
Who is this fucking Ruiz?
No, man. It wrinkles my shit. Let's grab a fuckin beer --
What? Did she say something?
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
What's the movie?
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.
Shit. No new pages. I don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
I know you're not calling Jimmy.
How'd they know who you were?
What the fuck do you have to complain about?
You know this guy?
Let's check out the penguins.
All the more reason.
No.
Calm down.
I fucking vouched for you. I vouched for you and you fucked me.
I don't want to take any more chances.
Let's just go get guns, I'd feel better.
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
The line's over there.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
Again with the fucking China Club! What do I look like a fucking Persian to you?
Yeah, sure. How much are they?
The videos.
Yes?
Where do you live?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
No, really, mate?
A lot of Persians?
That money is your per diem.
Yeah.
What about my keys?
We're square.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Edinburgh.
I'll get it.
Sit down. We ain't fixing to eat you. You look brand new in town. Pretty handy with a bottle.
Bet you like that shit.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
You looking good, Little. Real clean. Clean as the Board of Health. But you missing something.
How's it feel?
I'm working on it.
What you talking?
Let Billie finish.
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
Man, I don't want to hear all that.
The question is, who are you? You are in the darkness, but it's not your fault. Elijah Muhammad can bring you into the light.
I read. I study. Because the first thing a black man has to do is respect himself. Respect his body and his mind. Quit taking the white man's poison into your body: his cigarettes, his dope, his liquor, his white woman, his pork.
But everything the white man taught you, you learned. He told you you were a black heathen and you believed him. He told you how he took you out of darkness and brought you to the light. And you believed him. He taught you to worship a blond, blue-eyed God with white skin -- and you believed him. He told you black was a curse, you believed him. Did you ever look up the word black in the dictionary?
You got to learn everything the white man says and use it against him. The truth is laying there if you smart and read behind their words. It's buried there. You got to dig it out.
Where am I gonna start?
Ole Pete ain't much in the head, but he can lay in there with the wood.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.
I know.
It won't be easy.
I'm not made of glass.
Talk about what?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
What do you want me to do? Our people need me.
I don't care about myself, my wife and four children were sleeping in their beds, they have nothing to do with this.
No, that won't be necessary. I'll be all right.
The way I feel, I ought not to go out there today. In fact, I'm going to ease some of this tension by telling the black man not to fight himself -- that's all a part of the white man's big maneuver, to keep us fighting amongst ourselves, against each other. I'm not fighting anyone, that's not what we're here for.
Let's cancel.
That's right.
Just what is your question?
And like a fool I believe it.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
Let's go.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
Did you hear me?!
All day since you and Betty left. Brother Minister, I have to level with you. They gave me a mission. But I couldn't do it. I love y'all.
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
What does Sidney say?
No. You'll be marked for death.
You like 'em scrambled soft or hard, sweetie?
You the man.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
What did you do, Homey, palm it?
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
Are you sure?
We were parceled out, all five of us. I went to this reform school and lived at this woman's house. She was in charge.
You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
Creasy...  I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
Where do I find you?
What do you know about the cop? Tazinari. The one who made the ransom drop with Samuel Ramos?
Where does he live?
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[Si.]
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[What's the PIN number?]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
I'm here.
It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
How long you staying, Crease?
Your Spanish is good enough. You certainly look the part.
Creasy?
Creasy. Just call me Creasy.
I'm a bargain.
Hmmm?
So how come you know so much about those countries?
I know you're not.
The gunshot holds no fear.
Could I stop you?
That's not a question.
Jordan!
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
Of course I care about Pinta. She'll be as beautiful as her mother one day.
For a year?
When?
Yes, mom?
And bankruptcy. Where will that put me in the social strata?
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
She's young. She'll get over it.
[Is that good or bad?]
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
I read the file. You and Creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
Two tourists who never went home.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
You told me that she was a little tall, but that she wasn't bad looking at all.
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Hey, Herbie...
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
Where?
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
He was here last night till about two o'clock. I hear you really got stuck with a dog last night.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Who?
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
You told me.
What happen?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
So I'll call you tomorrow.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
I'll see you around.
What time is it?
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
It's loaded with what?
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Marty...
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
You gonna die without a son.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
You want a beer, Ang'?
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Hello, Ralph.
That's very nice-a you, Aunt Theresa.
Aunt Theresa, you got this big house here. I mean, you got this big house just for you and Marty. And I thought maybe Tommy's mother could come here and live with you and Marty.
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Y'all were short a couple cutters and we're what the Army sent.
What are you going to do with him?
I mean, what were you doing? Were you a resident or on a staff someplace?
Back home.
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Miss you, Walt.
Epidural hematoma?
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
I don't believe it's right for you to involve a boy who's not seventeen years old yet...
Now that's what I call real pretty. We can close up here and go into his belly.
He can't take much more time on the table.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
When?
Any time. Whenever we want.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Wait a second...
I'm impressed, Pierce. Naturally, the kind of job I have, I don't get much chance to keep up with what goes on in the OR.
We had a team at the 325th Evac last fall. I coached the boys myself.
Oh, certainly, Sergeant. My name is Captain George Limburger, and this is Captain Walter Camembert.
Let me translate. I've had some exposure to the language. The young man is from Brooklyn and he wants us to vacate this vehicle.
Look.
Don't worry, son. That's Captain McIntyre, and he's the best chest surgeon in the Far East and maybe in the whole U.S. Army. He'll fix you up fine. Your daddy saw to that.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
I don't feel anything.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
We'll cut him in on the bets we make. And still have enough profit to send Ho-Jon to college.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
All of them?
Okay, Major, honey.  I'm going to have a couple shots scotch and go to bed. I'd normally ask you to join me but obviously you're a female version of the routine Regular Army clown. And that turns me off, so just leave my outfit alone and we'll get along fine.  See you around the campus.
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.
Thank you, Captain Pierce.  It's been so long.
For a start. I just have a hunch... well, it isn't entirely a hunch...
Ayuh.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
Two-man job. How much blood has he had?
I didn't have much choice.
They missed the boat.
The one and only.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
You don't have any problem. You've got thirty good years ahead of you, easy. Maybe you'll have to cut down as you grow older, get along with just two fiancees, but...
That's really what I came here for. See what you guys recommend.
There ought to be a law against dentists reading. Matter of fact, I thought there was. Anyway, this is an obsession. He can't be persuaded out of it.
Pain bad, Ho-Jon?
The blonde dish.
Okay, Lieutenant Dish. I guess she's already... involved with somebody here.
You mean who hit who?
Yes, that's what I mean.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Thank you, Spearchucker. I'll certainly take a look at these. Where the hell did you ever get that name?
Well, there's one big satisfaction.
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
Huh?
Are you all right?
Action?
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
A hundred dollars!
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
Oh.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
Oh!
A deal?
Who, for instance?
What's the idea?
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Well, nobody asked yuh.
Oh, let me go, will you!
What do you do when you work?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
Did you find her?
The heelots!
Listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
St-rike!
Holy smoke! A half a heelot!
It must be some kind of a gag.
A what?
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Join the John Doe Club.
Yeah?  Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Well, I don't get it.
How about family? Got any family?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.  It's only natural that people
Let go of me!  This man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! He was paid to say so!  Do you deny that?
Were you paid for itor weren't you?
Yes! I was paid! But the
What difference does that make?
Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Shh!
Where's the stereo?
I've got to stop in there... Mr. Korda, do you know Frank Antonucci?
I... I'm Kevin. I 'm here to help you, D... Dave.
It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
The Old Guy? What kind of show of faith is that? I want Debbie.
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Roper...
Yep.
You've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
I grew up in Oakland... Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was.  So you're looking for "fast advancement".
Come on. Let's go for a drink.
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
You think you can learn, McCall?
First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,  "I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."  Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
Still needs work.
To run last?
We won!
Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
McCall, you all right?
Is the hostage injured?
Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
I worship you.
Hey.
I wanted to get this out of the way.
It's very nice.
Korda escaped.
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
Stay here, don't move.
Scott...
Prude.
Great, send him to the Marines. This guy's not a negotiator. He'll quit in two weeks.
Repoed this morning.
Who's running it?
Okay...
She said I have a son...
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
Remember, I'm not the one who chose this.
You sure he's going to come?
Where you plugged-in from?
Who?
Doesn't make sense.  How the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
He had access to the keys --
One condition.
What is it?
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
No.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.
Access established.
Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all?
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here!
Two thirty three a.m.
FOUR SECONDS TO IMPACT!
There goes the neighborhood.
THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!!
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
How'd you know?
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
The goddamned bastards.
Poor, yeah.
So what happened?
And now you have everything.
Bastard didn't even show.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
How much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
No disrespect, Tommy, but why would Mr. Arnold Rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
We're gonna be the winning side. It's like Rothstein said about that guy in Austria. We're gonna use Maranzano and Masseria. Let 'em knock each other bloody. And then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. What they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
I was calling yesterday.
It's a mask.
Why? You're the innocent one.
I booked passage to London.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
Bugsy, you and I don't need to be in business with Maranzano. We got more jobs than we can handle. That's not the problem.
So what is the problem?
No. We ain't even...
So we end up with everybody but the two Bosses, at our meet. We ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
You bastards, I said twenty!
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
But that's an hour's drive.
That's why I'm here.
We must be friends, Charlie.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Masseria's been after me too.
We were overdue to get hit.
Bring order out of chaos. If you lead... they'll follow.
Jesus.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
I'm a hard guy. I done more jobs than alla you combined. And I never said no. Not once. But dammit I don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
Anything ain't a very hard number.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
What?
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Back? You're sending me back?
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Bitchin' good cake.
Got a doctor on duty.
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
How was it? I don't recall.
An hour ago. <i></i> I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. I can't even bear to look at him... How about you? You're okay?
Hypnos?
How am I gonna get past the guards?
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.
Dating anyone?
Mom, I need to talk to you.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Aaron?
Here you go.  I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay?
He's an organic farmer.
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
This way?
I see.  How much?
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
Let's send out a pigeon!
Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Would you settle for a husband?
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
What! Who?
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Drunks are funny--
My friends?
Waiter!
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Diz--
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
Why me?
He's a house-afire!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 
What is it?
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't forget we have been chosen by the people of this commonwealth to--
Really, my dear--I don't feel like a thing.
Happy, for reasons there isn't time to go into--it's got to be Miller! We've given you the man. Now write the ticket.  Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.
Henry Hill.
The--head?
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
I mean, sir--if I'm going to stay in the Senate--I ought to know what I'm doing--at least, I ought to try to study the Bills that are coming up--
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--
Goodnight, Jeff.
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
Mr. President--
Oh, now--
Hello, Jefferson.
How's Amos, Ma?
Just fine.
The man downstairs said number--
Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't until I was fairly well along in the bus that I realized--
Did you say--bus?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this *with* you?
If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
Oh, just a day--
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand *way* back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
*This* is.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
Try sitting down.
On paper?
Well--gosh--that--that isn't "particulars," is it?
He did?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
You--you've *got* a first name, haven't you?
No!
Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little stream--
Well--no. I didn't. Why?
Do you want to dictate them?
Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator Paine must be right. Sometimes you-- you got to compromise a little--  And if you say so too, Saunders--if *you* think that's the thing to do--
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
How are the pigeons?
I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, it was nice of you to--  Uh--how's your father?
That's--that's splendid.
However, Senator Smith is still a member of this Body and as such has equal claim on the attention of the Chair--
Well, now--I wouldn't know about that. Mr. President--what happens to me in the morning--I mean about my having this floor to go on babbling?
I said--I mean--Washington didn't live to see it finished. Congress didn't move here from Philadelphia till eighteen hundred.
What does he want to--? What's *he* doing writing a Bill?
Joe! You *told* him to!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
What do you want, Senator?
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Well--me, too!
Joe, that's coming a long way in twenty years since I met you practising law down there in Main Street.
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Jim, I won't stand for it.
You won't stand for it?
Maybe he won't get up.
Will the Senator yield?
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Put that away, slug!  At your service!
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify.  Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
You are , aren't you?
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
What did they say?
It's wonderful.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
He played in the town band, too.
He did? I play the tuba
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.  It's about you.  Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
In a day or so, I think.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Huh?
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Yes, but you said
Fourteen carat?
Is that the best you've got?
Oh, yes sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
How is this, sir?
Better wire him right away, John.
Come on, John. What happened?
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days.  Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Yes.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
I've got one for Cobb
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Why, it's an artistic institution
Me?!
Why not?
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
Well, I don't know. I
Yes?
Proceed.
Oh, the poet? Where?
Don't pay any attention to her.
Christian Svenson.
Yes, sir.
Prairie? Oysters?
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
You try it.
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
Dr. Mumford.
Uh-huh.
Syndrome... Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  There is good news, though.
I don't want to hear any more today.
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
Not for this. Not me, you're not.
No?
What's that?
-- Which I don't necessarily agree.
I feel like we're making real progress here.
You must be Dr. Mumford of Mumford. Jeremy Brockett.
Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now.
We've been talking about her, mostly.
What do you think's wrong with her?
I'm sorry, your honor.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
What do you want to know?
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful?  You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
Where am I supposed to eat?
He told you.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
Okay.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
That's it? That's what you're giving me?
Don't you at least have a back door I can use?
I think you do.
Well... you see, the problem is --
What can you tell me about this?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
And he's where?
Which thing?
That's one way to put it.
I bet I know what changed your mind...  ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
Um-huh.
I think so.
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
In maybe three or four issues.
That's not quite what I said --
What do you want me to see?
What are you talking about?
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed?
Who else knows?
"Get to know your therapist."
At least you pulled yourself out...
English Lit.
Jeez, man. But you're good at it!
I'm honored.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
C'mon, friend.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
Oh yeah,... sorry bout that.  So who's this guy?
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
I'm sorry, it was an accident.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
Don't tell me we gotta go back out there?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.
You know your history.
I'm not?
That bad huh?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
It's everybody's problem!
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
What?... Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
You...! YOU...!
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
We coulda had 'em for free, all we had to do was give 'em your sister.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
He was the last time I saw him.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
The cape. The turban. She wouldn't understand.
It's late. I'm headin' home.
Yes!
They always call the great ones nuts.
I'm not that kind of girl.
Who?
Why?
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
I'm liking this.
There's a big difference.
Why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em! 
Nah.
Agents?
He's turned into a completely normal person!
Yes, Obie-wan.
You guys going to a costume party?
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
But... the silverware?
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Who are they?
Do we have to?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
It is a thing entirely unknown in diplomacy, that one government should assume a right to dictate to another, who is upon terms of equality, the conditions on which she should conduct her commerce; and, assuming such a right, second it by threatening language, in case of non-compliance.
I hope you will forgive me, Your Majesty, for requesting an audience at such a late hour, but I have traveled all the way from Moscow to see you, on a matter which cannot wait.
Forgive me, Your Majesty, I am about to make it.
Well, one thing immediately comes to mind, if what you are saying is true -- he would merely withdraw his army from Moscow and return to Poland for the winter.
General Kutusov, I would like to call a meeting of my cabinet tomorrow morning and have you present this idea to them.  I think it has merit and is worthy of consideration.
Please...
The 21st Dragoons, about two or three-hundred troopers.
Are you proposing to transfer command to me?
You realize what is at stake?
A treaty?  Don't be ridiculous. What treaty is this?  Who made it? Who has been giving orders?
I have just had the most vivid... dream... about Josephine.
A glass of champagne, please.
Bastia -- and you?
Ajaccio.
That's a nice city.  This is your first time here, isn't it?
The first reports came in at about ten.
Impossible, I don't believe it.
From what we can tell, there are hundreds of agents, all over the city.  The combustibles seem to have been carefully placed beforehand, and all the fire-engines have been removed from the city.
But this is not a matter which can be settled tonight, surely?
No one can say how the Emperor's thoughts work, Ambassador, and unless we move quickly, he might change his mind again.
I very much doubt that he will.
But he asked me to say...  on his behalf... that your achievements have increased his...  admiration for you, and that he believes... your success is predestined by heaven...  and that his army...
The weather is terrible, isn't it, sir?
Oh, I see... That must be a great burden.
Naturally, one does not take much stock in such a piece of filth but, on the other hand, it is not the sort of thing one can simply ignore. What do you think, Joseph?
You know I am only too happy to be of help to you, but surely this isn't the ideal moment to involve yourself in such matters.
Of course not, but such violence of feeling makes me wonder.
I am delighted to be of service to you again, Your Highness.  And I can tell you, my instructions came directly from the Emperor, with a caution to be discreet.
Oh... I see.  I understand.  How is... the Emperor?
And, you seem in excellent health, Your Highness.
Ah, how nice to meet you, General Bonaparte.  One has read so much about you lately.  Please sit down.
Oh... yes, of course!  Have you met my daughter, Hortense?
May I offer you a drink?
Oh, I don't want to put you to any inconvenience.
Oh, it's not the slightest inconvenience, General Bonaparte. It is an honor to have you here.
Yes, I'm afraid he is.  I believe he is riding.  I know he'll be heartbroken to have missed you.
Were you in love with him?
I know what you're doing in there.
Five minutes.
Certainly.
Look, Junot, you aren't going to leave this room until you explain yourself.
You know that... letter you showed me in Milan -- the one about Hippolyte Charles?
What was there to tell?
How do you know?
I was in her maid's room at an inn we stopped at for the night, outside of Dijon.  It was an adjoining room to Madame Bonaparte's.
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Did the Emperor or Empress give you any... instructions of any kind... before you left?
I hope that understanding is worth as much as you think it is, sire. My impression of Alexander is that he is moody and impressionable, capable of acting on sudden impulses which then lead to sudden embarrassments.  He is an unpredictable mixture of idealism and vanity.  You have dazzled him, and you have performed a diplomatic miracle, but Alexander is weak and he is easily influenced by the last one who has his ear.
Eugene de Beauharnais.
His moods at this time were complex and varied.
He made friends with a family called Columbier, and would later write of his first flirtation with their daughter, Caroline.
Anything you need.
And I can go free?
Well, let me in.
I don't know!
We didn't come here for Day-Day.
Where you going?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Man, this a cool house.
Go on and make yourself at home.  I'mma go get dressed for work.
You know what this is?
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Naw.  I bet'cha it's something better than air.
What's the B-G's?
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
Wait.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
You sure you don't wanna stay?
Hello, remember me?
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
Most definitely.
I did.  Is that door locked?
Nice neighborhood, huh?
You coming in?
Look, Roach, I know you ain't never worked in a record shop before and you're a little excited.  But if Pinky catches you doing that X-Games shit off his counter top, we both getting fired.  You feel me?
What is it?
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Roach, what are you doing?
'Scuse me, partner, but that's a ghetto knock.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his cousin Day-Day.
Debo!  Debo!
Take your car.
Make sure you look after my son out here. Don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.
Hell naw, Willie. Them fleas and tics must be sucking on yo' brain!
What's the matter?
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
What's he doing here?
That's my girl.
Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand.
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Amtrack?
Look...I've... I've got a problem. A big problem...
My security people are right next door.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
Could I see some identification, sir?
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
Daddy?
What's your point?
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
You get another chance in ten minutes.
How am I supposed to get away?
One thirty. California Ballroom.
I don't know.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
On TV.
All right.
I promise.
You got anything smaller?
That's right.
In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom.
The Governor. If I could just talk to her...
Oh, Jesus ...
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Laughs.
He's going to help the police. Your daddy is going to be a hero.
Come Back.
No.
Ben, I'm a Man of God.
How come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, Preacher?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
You have all sinned!
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
What's wrong, Mother?
Who?
What can we do, Mother?
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
What?
You go set down by the River.
Amen.
How?
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
You swore, Pearl!
Pearl! You ain't --
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
I don't know nothin'!
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Can I have my supper please?
Can I have milk too?
Just tell me now; where's the money hid?
No. No one never did.
What's their names?
Ahhh.  And is there -- a doll?
Do you want more children, Willa?
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
Heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!
Them kids!
None of your business, Madam.
Miz Cooper!
What?
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
Yeah. So?
'Booby Traps and Improvised Antipersonnel Devices'!
Coming up on the seventh day. It's okay, I checked Guiness. The record's eleven, and I'll beat that if I have to.  Listen, I... I know who he is.
Only family allowed, Nancy. You know the drill.
Then you know more than I do -- I haven't even been upstairs.
What's the Coroner got to say?
Who? Who did that?
How you know that?
Apparently he was crazy jealous. Nancy said they'd had a fight, Rod and Tina.
Mother, for petesakes.
Great
You okay?
Your father the cop. That's a good one.  Forget Fred Krueger. You don't want to know, believe me.
No more fights?
Thank you, Comrade.
Good evening, Anna.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
What was it like?
You want this?
No, that's not him...
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
Which lawyer?
Yes, Comrade?
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Guest?
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
A blue shirt, perhaps?
Good evening, Gaston.
Your Highness...
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
What proposition?
Razinin.
What did she say about me?
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
How are you, you three scoundrels?
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
What can I do about it?
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
What business?
Confess what?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
Yes!
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Why should I take a chance?
Me?
What?
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
I don't have to but I find it natural.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
Is this what you call the "butler"?
And what is your profession?
You are something we do not have in Russia.
Thank you. Thank you.
Ni-notchka.
The bayonet? Did you really?
Wounded? How?
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
It's false sentimentality.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
Do you like Scotch stories?
Anything, Ninotchka.
Did you make any change in this room?
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
Comrades! Good people of France!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
Yes... a little white house.
Not white, darling.
All right, we'll make it red.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
No! No!
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me. 
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
What does he say?
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open! 
Am I interrupting?
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
Hello, Leon darling!
Hello.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
Here, please...
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
No.
May I ask what has happened?
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
So ... let's go ...
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
No, you didn't, Bob.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
It'll never wash.  Pardoning them means we're guilty.  The people, the press will go nuts.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
I don't have a pistol.
Cox!  Fire him.
Richardson won't do that.  He'll resign.
I did?
But, sir, you're covered -- no one here gave orders to break into the damned Watergate.  We're clean.  It's only the Ellsberg thing, and if that comes out, it's "national security."
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
No, no, not tonight.  Don't let her in here.  I have too much to do.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
Jesus!
So?  You wanted Castro dead. Everybody wanted Castro dead.  If Hunt and the others are CIA, why don't we just throw this back in the CIA's lap? Let Richard Helms take the fall?
If they didn't tell Kennedy about Track 2, how did Hoover find out?
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
She understood something it's taken me twenty-five fucking years in politics to understand.  The CIA, the Mafia, the Wall Street bastards ...
Sir?
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.
Please!  I'll never let you down again, Mother.  Never.  I promise.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.
President Kennedy threatened to smash the CIA into a thousand pieces.  You could do the same ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
This is an extremely dangerous direction, Mr. President.  Terrible consequences can result from such enormous errors in judgement.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
It's between Nixon and a Kennedy again, Edgar ... Who do you want?
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
I always get my man.
Who we working for?
Gentlemen, I tried.  I told Kennedy to go into Cuba.  He heard me and he made his decision.  I appreciate your sentiments.  I've heard them from many fine Cuban patriots, but it's nothing I can do anything about.  Now, it's a long drive back to Dallas tonight, and Trini and I have got an early flight tomorrow to New York ...
What do you mean, Jack?
All kinds of shit would come out. Like the Ellsberg thing.  You knew about that, Henry, didn't you?
Don't be stupid.  The world needs you, Henry; you always saw the big picture. You were my equal in many ways.  You're the only friend I've got, Henry.
But your writings have changed the world, Mr. Chairman.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
I must say you look very good, Mr. Chairman.
Civil war is always the cruelest kind of war.
... Use his women.
Hi.
No, no.  I'm not powerless.  Because ... because I understand the system. I believe I can control it.  Maybe not control it totally.  But ... tame it enough to make it do some good.
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
Yeah ... I'm out.
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Anything.
Tomorrow.
No, it isn't.  I won't interfere with you anymore.  I'm finished trying.
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you?  Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick?  Sex?  Your secrets, your fantasies?  Or just me and you and ...
It'll be over soon.
Repartee, Dick -- very good.  Hey, I feel ten years younger!  It makes a helluva difference, let me tell ya! How's the lawyer life?
Won or lost?
Let's wait and see how you survive your first crisis, Rocky ...
How's that?
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
Didn't know there was any.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
Well what would you call him.
Yes, he has some hard bark on him.
You ain't heard from him?
He won't neither. He never has.
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
Does that look to you like about a '77 Ford, Wendell?
I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.
Llewelyn Moss?
No. Probably I don't.
What was the bullet?
Yes sir.
You gonna drive out there?
...What is it that Torbert says? About truth and justice?
Okay.
I put it in, Mama.
No.
I ain't got the money.
No.
To your husband.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
What's in the satchel?
Llewelyn.
Yeah.
Goin' out.
Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
Promise?
Llewelyn?
We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home.
...Where's the transponder?
What airport would you use.
I don't need to talk to you.
...I know where you are.
He feels... he felt... the more people looking...
Is somethin' wrong?
Will there be anything else?
Well... I need to see about closin'.
See about closing.
You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed.
Well... I need to close now --
Call it?
You stand to win everything. Call it.
...Don't put it in your pocket.
Somethin' like that.
It's all right.
If your expenses run higher I hope you'll trust us for it.
How well do you know Chigurh.
Could I get another room.
I know how he found me.
Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
That is correct. And how do I decide?
I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand?
Don't jack with me.
You should get the order you want.
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
...you are so goddamn weird.  Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Did you send anyone out there?
You're lying!
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
What about it?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night.  Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
Need something else?
Great. Good. Content...
Do you know who I am?
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Did you watch it yet?
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
I beg your pardon?
You knew Del?!
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
She's a good person to know.  So where did you study again?
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Ad lib?
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
You're in serious danger!
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
That's horrible!
Dr. David Ravell.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
I got this apartment with a guy.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
God, that's awful!
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
Even if he's falling asleep on his feet?
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
Relax, we brought the cash.
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
Hell of a way to die.
He told us it's in the Buick.
What 'look'?
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
...that's a good motto.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry...  ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
How'd they describe her?
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
If it helps bring her back, be my guest...
Isn't that the point?
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party.  But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
We know that...
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Did Chloe crack?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
Waitaminute -
- and share one of your graves.
That's right! We ain't really Negroes!
Visit those foreclosin' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the barrelhead and buy back the family farm. Hell, you ain't no kind of man if you ain't got land.
Well I - I ain't had it easy either, boys.  Uh, frankly, I - well I spilled my guts about the treasure.
What do we do now, Everett?
Whuhh...
Well, uh, I - I gotta get the family farm back before I can start thinkin' about that.
Everett, I never figured you for a paterfamilias.
'N turned into a frog -
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
You don't know where his goddamn folks from; you speakin' outcha asshole.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
We ain't gettin' married with his ring!  You said you'd changed!
That's right, honey.
You said it was in the rolltop desk!
You -
Well now honey, that ring is at the bottom of a pretty durned big lake.
I don't care if it's ninety thousand.
Yes, but honey -
Wait a minute! Who elected you leader a this outfit?
Suits me! I'm votin' for yours truly!
Don't I know it.
Who was fixing to betray us!
Pete, uh, I don't want ya to beat yourself up about this thing...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
...No treasure... I had two weeks left on my sentence...
Pete... I do apologize.
Well, it's a invitation-only affair; we'll have to sneak in through the service entrance-
Oh I remember 'em, colored fellas I believe, swell bunch a boys, sung into yon can and skedaddled.
She's at the five and dime.
You, Zack?
Great.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Come back here, kid!
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Yeah, I know.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night.  Survival of the fittest.
What's your name, boy?
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
I want to fly, sir!
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
No, sir.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Yes, sir!!
Is your brother a flyer?
Yeah.
Something tells me you've been here before.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
How did it go with you guys?
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
Do you go to school?
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
Want me to get a towel?
God.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Hi.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
Could you believe those girls!
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  I hope she comes.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
What?
You're welcome.
What the fuck is funny about this?
There is not one thing funny here.
You should see the look on your face.
Stop it!  Stop it!
Yes.
Remember that.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
You're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  Buy one, you get the rest for the same price. You know that.
Not that one.
This was your department, Junior.
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Forty-five minutes.  That's all you said you need.  That's like nothing.
And we're never getting in.
Everything okay?
Watch your mouth.
"Half?"  What did you, take a nap in math class?  Three people, three shares, one third.  Four point six six six repeating.
What do they want?
Feel okay?
Fuck.
I don't know, why?
Yeah, but where's the third guy?
Huh uh.
Well... is it loaded?
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
Dig it, you know those brothers over in San Fran... call themselves the Black Panthers too?
What the fuck?
Sit down, This concerns you too.  I don't need to say that your department's handling of the Black Panthers -- particularly Inspector Brimmer's "undercover operation" has been a complete travesty.
Inspector Brimmer
Yeah, it's me.
Brimmer you're fucked up...
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
Can't... they're having a PE meeting at Headquarters tonight, come on down. Check it out.
Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
Cy... I ain't even sure.
C'mon we'll walk and talk...
Can you make a deal with them?
But lots of our people don't read, man. They need strong imagery to help them out.
Rallying cry, it's an insurrection. Seale, that god damned Cleaver, Where the hell do these guys come from?
Wait a second there brother...
You were. infantry right?
Yeah... let me think about it.
Aw... uh... it's was just harassment. My driver's license expired.
Huey, man who's gonna straighten out the brothers if they get on my ass?
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
What? You don't like to see a traitor get hurt? I wonder why that is?
If you got something to say, say it.
You better just kill me Tyrone. And when Huey gets out, when Oakland's just wall to wall junkies, you tell him you blew away the only chance we all got. I'm sure he'll be real happy about that.
This cool the heat off you any?
Motherfuck... well then I got something to do.
Yeah.
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
Late summer.
It was you and it turned my teeth black for a month.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
I expect to try.
My boys... my boys... you seem to have been well fed.  Thank you for that, Colonel.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Are you going to meet with him?
Do you see that, Colonel?
The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved...
You're in no condition to ride.
We put out the word.  We'll start along the south side of the Santee...
Oh?
Less than a mile.  Forty-one wagons, a company of Redcoat infantry, horses at the rear.
She spoke?  Susan spoke?
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
What?
Don't go in there.
That's right.
You were an Englishman then...
And your principles?
No, thank the Lord.  He's more like his mother.
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently.
How far away?
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Best never to go climbing on old blowdowns like this, Ellie--sometimes they bite.
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Yes.
Have you got a death-wish, Ellen?
But don't you dare say that.
Be good to your mother, darlin'. She needs you.
You need a glass?
Not at all.
It's Church.
Yes, but--
It's funny, all right.
I had my reasons, Louis. We'll talk later. All right?
You want to rest a bit before you start?
What are those for?
I tried to tell myself I buried him alive. You know--Edgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat. But...
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night...you did, didn't you, Louis?
Rachel not feeling well?
Out of the mouths of babes, Louis.
--but I think the thought has crossed your mind.
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
I got eggs down here!
I'm going to try to do better.
You better get going, hon.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
What's in your head, boy?
Enough of that!  Name your terms.
We got that part.  Anything else?
See, that's where we're different. I trust you ... to do what it takes to get what you want.
What -- you don't have the medallion?
You'd best take a swim, Jack.
The situation has changed.
My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why?
Can I trust you?
Then why aren't you eating?
The curse drove you to gather this?
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Man overboard!
Commodore, you can't do that!
No.  The pirates have taken Will --
Difficult ... to say.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
Miss Swann.
How did you get off the island?
I'll tell lee.  Now, Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him, and that's where the whole problem starts.  This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl --
That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that --  -- makes this one here just a wee superflous.
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates.
No.
Move!
Why ask me?
Figured you wouldn't want to hear it.
Are you sure?  Jack -- this is not something you have to do.
No, it's not.
He's still breathing.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
No, thank you.
We will always love most that which we create.  Don't you agree, Susan?
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
You don't either.  We won't know anything until we find that guy and find out if he's alive or what.
And you think O'Brien is that leverage?
Well, yes.  The replicators are not as active at low temperatures.
Hey!
Yeah?  So what?
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
What?  Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel.  I was just thinking...
Aaabout...?
Oh yeah.  They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
You're afraid of him.
Susan!
Daniel...
Been out for six months now.
Oh yeah.  See, Susie, a man doesn't do the hard time and just pick up where he left off.  Oh no.  The big house does things to a man.
We'll see?  What does that mean?
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
But lo and behold he found another world that progress could annihilate!
Probably the caffeine.
Uh oh.  I remember that temper.
The nanobot... it's not here...
You made this out of my hair?
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.
I remember I was trying to help...
You!  I remember you!
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
And you have him?
I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Don't mind Mother.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Ah!  But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me.  Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
You have the cutest nose I've
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough?  What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
Anne, come here. Listen
Fine!  I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
All right, all right, don't mention it.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Well - it's only April.
Why not?
No!
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Quite so. Quite.
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens!  And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
Joe! A little snifter.  Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh?  Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
I knew you would, pal.  A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
To Old Madrid.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
Right.
Here you are.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Sorry, boss
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
A statement? Good.
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
Sure.
Come in, Joe. It's all right.
Double-strength!
Nobody seems to want to do anything  Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Have you seen this? 
Yes - the worm!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
No, sir!
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Oh no, sir. Some people are natural putterers. Others can never master it.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Mary Sue?
Can I ask you a question?
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
I won't.
I think it looks nice.
Where'd you get this?
But I really should get home.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
Oh, gosh no.
It is?
Want some bridge mix?
Rain.
The other one?
Weil great. You can watch TV upstairs.
Lemme see that.
You know him?
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
We don't have a choice Jen. We're stuck until he comes back.
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
What's wrong?
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
How come I'm still in black and white?
Oh, I don't know. Maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
You got the admissions letter.
Right here.
You want some berries?
Yeah ... Sort of ...
... Her father.
Right. And how did she dress him?
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
What?
BUD.
Why?
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Oh hi!
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Oh, hi.
TV repair.
Yeah. TV busted?
This is Barry.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
So it's ok if I bring her.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
It's not cool?
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
Yeah I can't.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
Hi. This is Jack.
So what are you doing tonight, Jack?
...just talking to you....
It doesn't matter.
What do you mean it doesn't matter?
Really?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
I'm fine. Who is this?
Uh-huh.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --
It was cool last night.
Hi.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
I saw a picture of you.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
How long have you known her?
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
....yeah....
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
Did you pick it up from the street?
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
You don't think you'll go --
I don't know.
Yes.
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
I think maybe over a hundred.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
What is this?
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna run the numbers, see what's what and I'll give you a call back --
Did you have my home phone number?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Did you do it?
I don't know.
You're hand is bleeding.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Hello, how are you?
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
337.....I'm sorry....
That was weird. I meant good.
It's alright.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
No thanks.
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
What happened?
Wait a minute --
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
Yes.
You have another house somewhere or something?
Well....what do you want, then?
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Seriously.
I know.
Don't puss out.
-- she didn't know what she was talking about --
It's not bad, it's ok.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Ok.
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
It's remarkable, Doctor. The patients are so subdued; so docile.
He's a writer, not a madman.
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
There I was taxed; it's true.
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
Good day, Marquis.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
What on earth would that require?
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
AND DID YOU?
Why was it you never took her by force?
Was it impotence?
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
You're a sentimental man.
I'll do everything in my power --
As you say, Doctor.
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
His wife was trying to escape; they caught her on the stair, and set upon her with bayonets.  "There but for the grace of God"... eh, Doctor?
Here it is; the last chapter.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
I'll be waiting.
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
Go on, child.
I am not a wealthy woman.
This is neither the time nor the place --
I wonder sometimes.
I can't
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
I did my best but, well, you know me
Uh-hub.
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
We are in no "pickle" -- as you would euphemistically have it.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy ^ g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
You are being typically theatrical, Marion. I need the Tribune to--
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
"Well, if you got drunk to talk to me about Miss Alexander, don't bother. I'm not interested. I've set back the sacred cause of reform, is that it? All right, if that's the way they want it, the people have made their choice. It's obvious the people prefer Jim Gettys to me."
Keep filming.
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
You're not doin' Hearst, are you?
You drink at 10 am, do you?
That's right, fella, no Hearst paper will run an RKO ad until you agree that CITIZEN KANE will never see the light of day.
Oh for God's sake, Louella-
Can I talk to Hearst?
All right! Enough! I've heard this from Schaefer and RKO. I've heard it from everyone--
Showing life
Like a bug.
This better be good
Don't whisper it. Don't even think it
Don't do this
Why her?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
Jesus Christ --
Mank, sit down. You missed the opening of the new picture but I'll go back--
Hedy Lamarr?
Me, I'm proud to be a Jew, I got no problem. You don't like it, fuck you. But with these guys it's like a dirty word. All they wanna be is good red- white-and-blue Americans, and the way they see it you can't be a good American and a Jew. So Sam Goldfish becomes Sam Goldwyn and David Selznick becomes David 0. Selznick -- like anyone's gonna think he's Irish for fuck's sake--
Is that from one of the Gospels?
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j-  that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
800,000 dollars fully covers the production budget and a little more. Hell, George, you even make a profit on the deal.
You talked to New York?
Yes
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
I know, I know! But what more can you expect of me?! I have pared this story down to the marrow to save money but to cut more would be to--!
You're with them, aren't you? You're going to bury my movie. They bought you!
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
No, we're jake. But listen-
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Oh, no--
He's Christ?
Where's your wife, Jake?
I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
You heard me, I said hit me.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
She ever go with them? Like Salvy?
Hey, watch your mouth. Don't talk like that. She's still my wife.
Do you see her yet?
I got good news, and I got bad news. The good news is you got your shot at the title. The bad news is...
Stick out your hands, Jake.
C'mon, Joey.
Screw you, Jack.
Answer me somethin'. What happened at the Copa with Salvy when I was out of town?
What?
Don't bullshit me, Joey. You ain't tellin' me the truth.
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Did you ever fuck my wife?
Why not? There's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. I don't see why I shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
Does that mean...
It means I'm through with boxing. I'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. I'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
At night?
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
I can't find my ball.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Come over here.
Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
Yeah, what?
I went out.
I took the kids to my sister's.
I went to the movies.
Answer me when I talk to you. What happened that night?
Jake, no --
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
You did?
Get the fuck outa here. Whadda you mean nothing'? You stupid bitch!
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
OK. Talk.
Why don't you just call him up?
I dunno.
Sure, what else is new?
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Excuse me, I'm talking to my sister in-law.
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
He has it. Thank you.
From the looks of Davidson's cable, it might even go higher than that. And we haven't even got a camera over there.
Jefferies?
But his leg!
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
I can't do that.
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
For what?
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
I'll send you some comic books.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Can you get me that ring back?
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
I'm not ready for marriage.
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
Police?
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
How much do you think you'll need?
How's your leg?
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
Make the one you want.
You mean leave the magazine?
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Tell me about it.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
What are you getting at?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
No comment.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
Someone not his wife?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
It doesn't make sense to me.
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Your name?
A new disease.
Machismo?
Just him.
Jim Stark.
We got a cookaboo inside.  He wounded some kid earlier.
Smashed the front door.
What's he going to pull--
Crunch--my father's--You going to kill him?
You still want to go home, Moose?
No.
You awake?
We don't have time.
Ten years?  Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
Son--this is all happening so fast--
You don't?
No.  I definitely don't.  I did the sa--
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
Who's there?  Anyone there?
She keep it to protect herself, sir. She scared without a man in the house.
What do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
You know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
He's a wheel.  So's she.  It's hard to make friends with them.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
We know.
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
Mom and Dad.  I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
I'm here.
Can I keep it?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
They like you.  Okay?
Who's that?
I shot at one of them.
'Bye, Mom.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Do I have to spell it out?
Wash up and go home.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Yeah--why--
Goodbye!  See you!
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Oh, Jim!
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
You don't need to do that.
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
Shall I show you the nursery?  It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Do you think your father means that?
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
Didn't you forget something?
So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams.
Don't hurt him...
To all those cons...
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
Didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
Jack. Jack Bangs.
Since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
They've never done a robbery?
You said they've run guns, in their trucks. So they'll have guns. To do this robbery. They'll have serious guns.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
What?
You said it a million times!
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
I shared his cell!
She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart.
Bam Bam.
Her brother.
You wrote Ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working Christmas Eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. And the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. That a true story now?
What the fuck are you talking about.
You'd have to get me inside.  Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
Why not.
What'd you tell that casino manager?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
No gun.
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
Where the HELL did he go?
I can't go back to Vegas...
Capades? They don't do it. Mittens? Outlawed. Why?
I'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three Russian girls, they look like Meryl Streep, they can juggle anything.
The Powwow Safe?
Cancer-sucker.
My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
What the hell was that about --
Get to thinking about it, it won't happen.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.
Don't look like he missed the sunlight.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Just a roach, Zook.
Tell her... I'll be there ...
NO!!!
...for Christmas...
How'd you know I'd do it.
I'm sorry man, I shoulda picked you up personally at the pen. This whole week's just been crazy. I've had my head up my ass the entire time.
No, you'd keep me for yourself. Four years fuckin' punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.
I might break you, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch. You'd be suckin' the dick and going down on a mangy T-bone hound.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
Didn't I tell ya not to worry?  Vic was worried.
Let Nice Guy set you up at Long Beach. Give ya some cash, get that Scagnetti fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.
And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
I don't know, but somebody did.
So he'll tell us who the fuck set us up.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
Pam Grier.
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
Yeah.
The Brewers.
Tell me more about Cabot.
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
Wong?
Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry- fucking-Vale.
Nobody's trading with anybody! Look, this ain't a goddamn fuckin' city counsel meeting! Listen up Mr. Pink. We got two ways here, my way or the highway. And you can go down either of 'em. So what's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?
That's your proof?
He don't tip.
He don't believe in it?  You don't believe in it?
That fuckin' shooting spree in the store.
No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat-It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin' grade.
I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
As soon as I heard the alarm, I saw the cops.
Uh-uh, just cops.
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
One question: Do they have a sheet on you, where you told him you're from?
He got it in the belly. He's still alive, but won't be for long.
Maybe he did.
What's the matter with her?
But you eat, don't you?
Yeah.
He's learning his letters.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
So that was why she tried to run away.
We can't stay here!
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
Go on. Tell me more about her.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
Why do you think?
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
Maybe it's better that way.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
How does she draw?
At the ranch maybe?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
How's that?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
All right, you didn't know.
I can't take her with me.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
It isn't that --
She mustn't -- don't you let her --
That something I shouldn't see?
They shouldn't have done that.
Goodbye and thanks.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
I said let's go.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.  We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?
Me, too. 101?
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
You better be careful. I heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  Hey, what class do we have next?
Ouch!!
Hey, look, I'm Wilma Flintstone.
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Where the hell are we?
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
What about you, Buddy?
Better try a little higher.
Now, come on -- you know I'm not ready for that kind of --
Cindy, please! It's a matter of life and death. I'm asking you a friend.
There's something I really want to share with you.
Look, what I'm trying to say --
I don't care. You pick.
It's okay.
Oh, my God, Ray! What are you doing here?
What's your location? I repeat, what's your location?
Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
What the hell are you doing?
My child you are the only survivor.
So, do you think you made it into the class?
Gear. You know, clothing.
Yes, I thought that it would be best.
Let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
Professor, I think you should see this.
Yours, or the turkeys?
You're not wearing a belt.
Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
No thanks.
Sit down and join us, Cindy.
What happened?
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
But Mom, the video's not over.
In here, Mom...
Are you Chip Sutphin?
I got somebody you could run over, Mother!
Sorry, son.  This is a matter for adults.
I love that you're my wife.
Yeah! Oohhhh! Get it!
There's Dede! He's my favorite chickadee! He's here every morning for breakfast.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...It's called "Chicks with Dicks".
I certainly did.
You mean to tell me the day I came over to Mrs. Ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
That's not gum in your mouth, is it?
Did you find your Franklin Mint egg, Rosemary darling?
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Mrs. Ackerman, do you recycle?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
Man, that one made me puke!
That's a Franklin Mint piece. Eight dollars.
You know who I am, August?
Where?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
I don't like this.
Mr. Ward will see you in just a few minutes. Won't you wait, Dr. Judd?
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
I'll give you a check.
About forty-five dollars.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
What were you talking about?
Nothing.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
But you have treated me that way.
 What have you done about Irving August?
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Who the devil is he?
Gregory   you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
I know  I shouldn't have told you
Well?
I don't know.
What's that?
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.
My window - - through which I see the world.
And you believe that?
He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat dry?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
But why come to me?
Well, it won't work. Love and understanding won't make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.
Yes. When I tell you.
Cloven hoof?
Would they hurt her?
I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
Because I have something very important to do.
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
Yes?
That was quick.
No, I think you look... fine.
No, not really.
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
You play an instrument?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Mother, father, sister.
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
I know that I just don't feel a connection with very many people, so I don't waste time with people I don't feel one with.
So what about kids?
Impotent.
You are?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
Nothing I can't finish later.
It's a personal project I'm working on.
What kind of personal project?
All of these are interviews?
Why not?
What will you do when the money runs out?
Tell me your name.
Do you talk to him?
Yes, I have. I will.
Have you fantasized about me?
No.
Why not?
Yes.
How could I, with all these nice people stopping by? The fact is that I've lived by myself for so long, I can't imagine living with another person. It's amazing what you can get used to if enough time goes by. And anyway, I'm asking the questions. Are you happy?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Subtlety?
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Possibly.
I don't know. I really would rather not talk about it.
Graham...
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Something wrong?
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.
Yes, I remember. What do you do when these moods overtake you?
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
God, no.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
What visitor?
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Yes.
Why?
There are many things that can exert control over one's life, good and bad. Religion, greed, philanthropy, drugs.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
What are you talking about?
Will you stop? Jesus.
Fine.
Why not?
Because I never got around to it.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Then why'd you call me?
What!?
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know that for sure.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
It's a sun dress.
I was just trying to --
Thank you.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.
And are you here to berate me for making her that way?
Nope.
Talking.
That's all.
And you ask questions, right?
That depends on you. One woman only used three minutes. Another filled up three two hour tapes.
He said that my hand felt good.
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Why?
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Could be risky.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
You told Ann about this?
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
What tapes?
John, as a lawyer, you should know that those tapes are private property.
I'm not kidding, Graham, you'd better do what I say. Give me those tapes.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Give me your keys.
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!
Yeah.
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
He'll be really mad.
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Did you touch anything? Move anything before we got here?
That's great, Forsythe, great. Thanks.
OK. But late.
Go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. It'll have to do for now.  What's your number? The number of your apartment?
I know. You're bored already. Transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
Rog, I gotta talk serious to you. Really. Listen. Ya listening? OK. I want you to come into this with me. To tell the honest-to-God truth, I'm lonely.  All Hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. He wanted you in anyway. That's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. We would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
Yes?
That you, Rog?
He didn't make it.
What?
Infantile regression.
You got it!
I know, I know, it's just...
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
How did you come by this scenario?
Why Janet?
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
In a way...
Judge Wright?  Now, Betty? First name terms, surely!
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Yes, Betty.
I NEED SOME
WHAT A JOKE...
YOU FEL LIKE CHOKING YOU PLAY FOR BROKE...
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
CRIMINAL
This could be worse than the old series.
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
They're from both of us.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Oh yeah.
No, we're paying for the wine.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
Just tell me.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
When do we get to drink it?
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
We're on.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
Aye-aye, captain.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad.  It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
Obsessively.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Fucker hit into us.
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
I said okay?
No.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to.  I want to go home.
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
What's that?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Yeah.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think?  So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Why don't you come in?
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
What are you drinking?
Yeah, I know.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Well, nice to see you now.
Okay.
Maya.
I am.
Not me. I'm not drinking.
How much skin and stem contact?
See you, Miles. You take care.
It was a surprise, Mom.
You talked to Wendy?
Miles, when are you going to get married again?
Daddy.
It tastes funny.
The same windows.
I see.
Explain noises.
He was only a year and half old.
I can feel air.
It needs batteries.
We might lose the signal.
I'm getting out now.
So the aliens can't read our minds.
Bimboo?
Dad.
They said one of two things could happen. One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
Okay.  So he was tall?
Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
All I did was kiss a girl.
What friend is that?
I didn't just come along. I was looking for you.  Jake said you were out there. I saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. Said you boys took a Henry off one of McKendrick's men. I wanted to see it.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
Goodbye?
This is a brutal land.
Maybe I'll go along as far as Chimayo. Get me some clothes. Maybe a bath.
I think I'll ride along with the lady here. Just take a look at this farmland before I come into Silverado. See what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I'll see you around.
You might make a farmer yet.
What happened?
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
I'm done talking. Get out.
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
Came to the wrong town. I don't tolerate this kind of thing. It's hard on the peace, and it's hard on the furniture. Now, knowing a bit about Carter here, I'm going to let you go without paying for the damages. But go you will, and I mean now.
I don't like that word much, Carter.
Hello, Rae.
I heard that too.
Let's talk about that.  I'm looking for some men.
So we understand each other?
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I thought we talked about that.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
Is this a fair mix?
You really are a gambler.
What do you mean?
It's an advance. We want him to know he's going to be happy here.
-- Forgive me, Mr. Taransky.  I'm just trying to understand.  All these films, TV appearances, magazine covers, internet interviews, publicity photos, snapshots from her childhood -- all fake.  This is fake, this is fake -- fake, fake, fake, all fake.
So, of course, you couldn't kill Simone because there never was a Simone.
It wasn't her body.  It was her body of work.
I want to reassure you, Elaine, there's absolutely nothing going on between Viktor and I.
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
Al least a contingency for wardrobe.  Any woman can go up a dress size.
Elaine, talking to you now, not as Viktor, director, but Viktor, ex husband... what the hell happened to you?
-- She already is.  Simone's not coming over, Elaine.  Not tonight, not ever.  I want you back, Elaine.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
You're drunker than I thought.  Are you doing that again?
Because obviously she existed, right?
Yes, call me Simone.
You're with me to be close to her?
With everything that was going on in my life, I just needed to drop out of sight for a while -- I needed time.  Viktor bought me that time.  I owe him so much.
Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
Hello, Hal.
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
Yes, perfect.  As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
Why not?
Is she here?
-- Mr. Taransky, Mr. Taransky... thank God.  I've been trying to see you, calling -- Your assistant wouldn't put me through.  I told her it was a matter of life and death.  I was afraid I wouldn't get to you in time --
Good for you, Hank.
It can -- with my new computer code, you and me, we can do it together.
An eye -- for performance.  You know the truth when you see it.  I know.  I've seen your movies.  I love your movies.
You do?
Do I hear the sound of... wedding bells?
She's at the premiere of "A Cold Day In Hell".  But I think she send someone from Acquisitions.
There was no other way.
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
Why?
One thing bothered me.
Dad, you know I don't like to get between you and mom but she's feeling down right now.  She broke up with Kent.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
Happy birthday, Lainey.  Do you like it?
Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
Who's the hostage, Sayer, her or you?  You look kind of "captive" yourself.  While you're spending every waking hour obsessing over Simone, guess what, I guarantee she doesn't even know you exist.  Get off my property or I'll call the cops.
-- I bet you have.
I'm keeping it in trust.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
Abduction?
Don't you?
Whatever it is, it's dark.
Taller, Viktor.
I beg you.  You can't do this to me.
I had three other offers.  I only signed on to this picture out of... loyalty.
Would you like me to read?
Thank you.
Yes, of course it is.  You know you have a line here.  Not a wrinkle.  Actually, more of a dimple.  I've been thinking of incorporating something like that in Simone.
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
What if it catches on fire?
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
You are birth of... what?  A Phenomenon.  A miracle.  A new era in show business.  All I wanted to do was finish the film.
Is that better, Mr. Taransky?
No.  I... just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Mr. Taransky, we both know I was nothing without you.  I was computer code -- ones and zeros.
You know what I'm talking about.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.
Congratulations.
You mean aneurysm.
I don't tell her a thing.
Know what?
You said the "s" word.
I didn't know you were funny.
No.
Did you think the play sucked big time?
Cats?
I don't know.
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
You were great in the play, Cole.
What?
Sometimes people think they lose things and they didn't really lose them. It just gets moved.
Dead people.
Like what?
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
What's a "little while?"
See?
Listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... I want my Nikes and I want them now!
Rod... I have to get back to my job.
Dammit, Carl!!!!
There's something weird going on here, Suzie.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
You'll be back.
It's time to make amends.
Amends...?
Hey -- Macdonald's farm!
Shit!
Is that right?
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.
Suzie --
Wait a minute --
You're... limping.
Listen to me --
She's a Tarot Card Reader at a shopping mall.
Someone better tell Mac.
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
What you up to?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Grant, where'd you go?
He tried to kill you, Starla.
Starla, it ain't --
Surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
My sister Megan, she's a big fat cow. Was then, even more so now. I'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
What?
It's just a work thing.
Welcome home.
When one sees you they all see you.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Having fun.
Driving?
Where you from?
Shoot.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Jesus!!!
You know this guy, don't you?
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
Absolutely.
What are you thinking?
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
What are you doin' now?
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Yeah?
Shit! No one's here.
Liquid gold.
Hit the brakes!
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
What does the old Timex say?
Bandit?
Yeah, guy?
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
I hate to say it...
Then don't.
We're gone.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
We're outta motion lotion.
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
Thanks for the break. Bandit, this here's the Dixie Chicken.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
This is Bandit I. Over.
That's the point, Dickey.
It's gotta be tough keeping an eye on everything.
Welcome to the new Bureau. Nobody shares information anymore, it's become synonymous with job security.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
Mortal.
-- Agent Carruthers. Do you know where is he now?
And this is your car, isn't it?
You woulda?
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
There are certain meds, certain intravenous measures that can counteract some of the damage you've done, but I'd have to administer them myself.
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!
So he's personally issued the contract on Israel?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
...A paternity suit, filed 1967...
You realize that Sparraza has had thirty-six major medical procedures performed on him since 1953? Elective plastic surgery, every single one --
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Alright, now Buzzy -- this is, this is it, here, okay, so listen to me careful and wait till I'm finished 'cuz we got no room for slop.
... Jesus... what for?
Yeah... Sid?
Right, you got clicks, anything?
-- No, no, not when y'can see the shore. I hear ya.
Okay, well, y'know, then we just gotta get Israel.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
What!?
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
What?
No, no, no, y'gotta go in and get him, pull'm out of wherever he at, forget all that other shit, that's just f'flavor. I'm still getting lil' bits'a this-n-that from this cat Padiche, the man contacting me... Right now, what we got --  -- Is a number and a name... Buddy Israel.
You're being tricked.  Sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  He's figured out they're made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he's going to create a negative neutrino field.  Twenty four hours a day, until they're back on Earth.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
In the lab.  With her, probably.
What?
He'll let me in.
That depends.
Personally, I think it's God.  At least, it fits my definition.
I'm not sure.  It started with Gibarian.  He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there.  By this time, we were getting visitors, too.  He was desperately trying to figure it out.  Day and night.  Who was she?
Rheya.
We can liquidate the station.  Take the Athena back.
What happened?
What plan?
I wasn't.
I am.  Please come with me.  I don't want to do this here.
It's something.
I like that too.
He has a point.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
What are you taking?
What does it want?
When?
He won't do it.
Snow, get up here, now.
It's terrific Win.
You all right?
I can't open it.
Let go!
Not exactly.
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though.  Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
You don't have to, now.
Say goodbye, Mike.
Tommy...!
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Okay?
Oh, some shit.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Why?
Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
It is my fault!  I'm responsible for her!
What did you watch?
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
Let me drive...
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
Anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up!  He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone!  He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away!  Koontz, please!
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
I'm not lettin' no one go.
I don't think she can sing, either.
Here you go, Pete.
Same old stuff.  How's the pharmacy?
I know.  Still thinking about retiring?
Oh, sure.
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Harry
I know.  I've got one too.
You get mugged or something?
You taking extension classes, Mr. Jameson?
I got a question, college boy.  What the hell am I supposed to do with these!?  I ask for disaster, pathos, what do I get?  Salvador Dali!  When I want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I'll ask for--
I don't give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  I can't print this surreal garbage!
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
You're making my life difficult.
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
Can I get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
Even if they're not clever.
Some prep school thing.
What are you doing this weekend?
Oh, don't do it on my account--
No, it wasn't only you-- it -- it just wasn't my style.  Hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  Someplace nice for a change.
They keep saying there's nothing I could've done.  That's a lie.  I could've done something.  If only I'd paid attention to my feelings.
You'd feel what?
Peter?
This may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Otto, we are mere mortals. You must never forget your own limits--
Not a lot.  I saw inside of the Science Center.  What exactly happened?
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Up here, Docky Ocky!
How did he ever find out about that ammunition train?
Jawohl.
Just pulled the old match gag, see!
Roger.
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
Brother, were we all wet about you!
What did you expect, glamor boy? The Officers' Club with a steam room and a massage maybe?
Just a minute. You made a couple of cracks before and I let them slide. But I don't intend to take any more. If you resent my having money, start a revolution, but get off my back.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
Not you.
Let's blow, Chauncey.
What is your number?
No bother. I'm very grateful for a little company. You see, I suffer from insomnia.
I didn't do it. I was in the Frankfurt station and the train was three miles away when it blew up.
Well, Herr Inspector! How did you find the camp? Crowded but gemuetlich, shall we say?
Jawohl.
Then droppen Sie dead!
Coffee? Milk? Or how about a little cocoa?
Who wants to eat? I just wanna get over there!
So what? There's other women!
Hey! This is with a typewriter! It's from a finance company!
Do Grable.
Sergeant Hoffman from Barrack 4.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
You're wasting your time, Duke.  Outside, everybody! Let's get it over with.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
What's the matter, boys? Is my slip showing?
You heard that, Sefton?
You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
Who did?
Today's Camp News!  Father Murray announces that due to local regulations the Christmas midnight Mass will be held at seven in the morning!
Yeah?
And what's that crack supposed to mean?
Thirty-fifth.
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
December seventh, forty-one.
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Which one of us is the informer?
Schulz, you're off your nut!
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
Wunderbar! Maybe they are too wunderbar for my wife. But there is a piano teacher in the village --
That is my wife.
That wouldn't be the cigarettes you took us for last night?
So you're stuck with me, eh?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
It should be noted, sir, that the collapse of the Veridian star would produce a shock wave similar to the one we observed at Amargosa.
Wait a minute. I thought you've always been afraid it would overload your neural net.
Well?
Could we access the defective coil and trigger their cloak?
The ships are bearing at 3-1-0 mark 2-1-5. Distance: three light years.
Deck 15, section 21-alpha.
You did it, Kirk!  Damage report, Ensign.
Do you remember him?
Your "sixth sense"- I've always wondered where it came from.  And what about Soran?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
That's right.
Aye.
Keep her together until I get back.
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
There's still no indication of why they attacked the station?
Is there a problem?
Report.
You felt it was no longer your responsibility to carry on the family line.
Status!
Tractor beam, aye!
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
David!... What went wrong?
It's snow. Snow in the same sector. Fantastic!
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
Your timing is excellent, Mr. Scott. You've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. How much refit time till we can take her out again?
What's wrong?
What? What are you saying?
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
See! That shimmering area.
About a dozen officers and men.
Sir, planet core readings unstable... Changing rapidly...
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Would you look at that?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Harry, you don't have to believe! I'm not even sure I believe. But if there's even a chance that Spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
Wait! Give me a chance --
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
I -- saw no future --
Kirk, I must have your thoughts. May I join your mind?
... The needs of the few...
What must I do?
But at what cost? Your ship... Your son.
How can you tell that?
My Lord... what are your orders?
Sir, may I --
It would destroy such life in favor of its new matrix --
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
I don't dispute that in the wrong hands --
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
But what if they went -- nowhere?
Commander, we are receiving. This is Regula I. Go ahead.
Taking Genesis? Who? Who is taking Genesis?
It is a far far better thing I do than I have ever done before... a far better resting place I go to than I have ever known...
Thanks a lot. No respect from my offspring --
David --
Go back. I'm going to kill him.
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
Beyond what I told you, sir, it is classified information.
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
Well done, Commander.
How soon --
We encoded four minutes --
Uh, no...  I should be on the bridge.
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
Careful: Not all at once. <u>The</u> <u>engine room</u>. Lock on target and prepare to fire.
Inoperative.
Genesis, what's that?
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
I don't know you. But you. I never forget a face. Mister Chekov, isn't it?  I never thought to see your face again.
Listen to me -- you men and women --
All is well, sir. You have the coordinates to beam up Genesis...
I had me a wee bout -- but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.
Yes, Spock.
Meaning you can't even beam us back?
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
You are going to remind me that logic alone dictates your actions.
How far?
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
It literally is Genesis...
What's she doing here?
... Blind as a Tiberian Bat. What do you make of the plantoid beyond?
Estimating nebula penetration in two minutes. Reliant is closing.
Kirk here.
In my quarters, Uhura.
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
I failed to resolve the situation.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
This is damned peculiar.  Yellow alert.
Indeterminate life signs.
Are you asking me if we are playing out that scenario now, Lieutenant?
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Stop engines.
Shields activated!
Lieutenant, how many times have you piloted a Starship out of Spacedock?
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
You are half human. The Computer knows that.
Sorry if I spoke out of turn.
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
... My shoes...
Fundoscopic examination --
Yes, sir.
Ah, well done, team 2.
Status report, Admiral!
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
We don't know. It's using forms of energy our best scientists do not understand...
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Despite all the things they are teaching us we have to return George and Gracie to the open sea.
Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
A landlubber. Come on, what the hell were you boys really trying to do back there? Was it some kinda macho thing? If that's all, I'm gonna be real disappointed. I hate that macho type.
Implicitly.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Wanna try it from the top?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
I bet you're a damn good poker player.
... Gone?!
It would be improper to refer to you as Jim while you are in command, Admiral... Also, I must apologize for my attire.  I seem to have misplaced my uniform.
Home in on the strongest signal. Descend from orbit.
Admiral, if I may: we're probably already visible to the tracking devices of the time.
We could rig a device to collect their high energy photons safely; we could then inject the photons into the dilithium chamber, causing crystalline restructure.... Theoretically.
You don't have to lie... You could exaggerate.
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
No, Admiral... But is the human thing to do.
Aye, sir. Descending.
10,000 M.S.L., Admiral.
I'll have bearing and distance for you, sir.
Bearing!
Scotty, how long is this bay?
Two?
Full power, sir.
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
Admiral, I'd like to continue my work on the ship until you leave.
Well, that's different.
That's the ticket, laddie.
All right, then this is old stuff to you.
Father...?
It is not an effort. You are my son.  Besides; I am most impressed with your performance in this -- crises.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
Deceive us?
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
Will it?
When we're forced away by the terrain, we'll use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest concentrations. Once we're there, transport will be virtually impossible...
Jak'tahla?
For one thing, your legs are shorter than everyone else's.
But they are in a constant state of growth. Do you find it difficult to adapt?  A child's specifications are never the same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not... trip over your own feet.
Androids... don't have...fun.
Data doesn't breathe.
Captain, Geordi...?
Yes... that looks like them.
What's the last thing you remember, Data...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
A planet in Federation space...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
Why would they fire at him without provocation?
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
You got me, Commander.
We're pulling it like a zipper across space...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Bridge to Captain Picard. We are approaching sector four-four-one.
The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser fire!
Say the greeting again...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
Nomadic, collectors of precious metals, jewels...
You haven't done that in a long time...
Why don't you try sitting up?
Sir, I am not showing any change in metaphasic flux levels...
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
Yes. But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got.
You actually performed surgery...?
I do not know what you are referring to.
Yes...
I have helm control.
Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up.
What's still there?
Altitude fifty kilometers...
Entering the upper ionospere...
Passing one-half light speed. The starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
It'll be tight, but we should make it.
It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
Yes.
What do you want?
You're lying.
Friends from Cornell...
Lie. That's one. Keep going.
That's impossible.
Why?
Captain...?
Worf, have Doctor Crusher, Mister La Forge and a security team meet me in Transporter Room Three. Civilian clothes.
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Report.
They're re-routing the deflector power conduits...
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Right.
Emergency override!
Someone...?
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
Worf? Is something wrong?
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Or not to be -
We're explorers not diplomats!
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
It takes a lot of effort.
There... were no other ships in the sector.
I checked the data banks, yes.
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
And your coat.
How much time's left of your sentence?
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Surely not.
According to my information, today.
Never been this close.
I don't believe our own conduct will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy...
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
I was PREJUDUCED by those achievements.
But I am not human. I am only -
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Not as yet, sir.
We've got a crew of three hundred turning their own quarters inside out,  but the killers may be among them. Surely they've disposed of these boots by now. Wouldn't it have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
If you are logical.
And if they're still in place?
They dinna fire on themselves. And there were no other ships present.
They you're talking about a dreadful new engine of destruction, Mr. Spock.
And they'd be right. We have no evidence - just a theory that happens to fit the facts...
Under impulse power she expends fuel like any other ship. We call it "Plasma" - I do not know the Klingon name for it, but by any name it is merely ionized gas.
Yes, please continue.
Do you know where you are?
Indefinitely.
Please, Beverly, this is hard enough.
When was he... created?
About twenty-five years ago. They probably used a hair follicle or skin cell.
Beverly, come in.
Is he very much like you were?
To new worlds...
How long until we reach the fleet?
Dr. Soong must have found it unnecessary in later versions.
No.
Is he sincere about wanting peace?
He's getting his cloak back. We have exhausted our compliment of photon torpedoes. Phaser banks are down to four percent.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.
Captain. I think it is inappropriate for a Starfleet officer to appear...  Naked.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Captain, with all due respect to diplomatic protocols  -- the Federation Council's not sitting out here, we are.
Anything.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
I want to end the centuries of mistrust. I want to be your ally, not your enemy. As a first step I propose we eliminate the Neutral Zone and begin a free and open exchange of goods and ideas.
Right now, youre thinking this all sounds too good to be true?
No one knew what to do. Finally I was taken to a doctor who had some experience with Terran illnesses and I was finally diagnosed with Shalaft's syndrome. Do you know of it, Captain?
Not quite. I envy the hair- line.
Yes. The eyes have it.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
Were we always explorers?
Oh, but it does.  We will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. Not the Romulans and not your mighty Federation. We're a race bred for war. For conquest.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
And what of the Enterprise?
Long ago.
Yes.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
This is a mistake.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
No -- this is wasting time.
Let her pursue -- drop cloak on the aft port quadrant and prepare for full emergency stop.
They will obey, Praetor.
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
I have a purpose.
Benny, God, take it easy...
Right in line with that burning tree.
I don't see anything.
How much are your rooms?
I'll have to run your card off now.
I understand.
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
Shermin...
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
What?
Minneapolis.
Closed?
Are you from up there? Space?
Space?
A baby is a new person?
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
But I speak English.
Yes?
Goodbye.
You thought we were a different planet?!
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
I don't understand 'friend.'
Are you my friend?
Yes.
Do you have music up there?
No. Get in.
Are you angry at me?
I must meet my ship.
Where did you learn that?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
I will.
Slow down, slow down.
They after you?
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Hello...
No problem.
Leave him alone, Tran.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
This piece of puke hired me to kill you, baby.  Do you believe that? Isn't that right, Tran?  You pinhead.
You can't just... kill him.
You were supposed to go downstairs, baby.
I said, 'Yeah.  I'd even do it for free.'
I know you Faith.  You're afraid of something.  What's going on?
Then what?  Then what, Lenny?!  You going to protect me?  Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny.  You don't even have a gun.
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Just as well, Lenny.  You gotta get past it.  I mean sure, Faith was by far the most outstanding woman a guy like you could ever hope to get, I mean it's completely and deeply humiliating that she's gone, but it's over, campadre.
Let's work it.
Come on, Lenny.  You used to be good at this stuff.  Play it down. What's the perp doing?
But at the same time he's sending the signal to her--
Mace... no disrespect... but you run this on the 11 o'clock news, by midnight you got the biggest riot in history.  They'll see the fucking smoke from Canada.
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
No plan is perfect, Lenny.  Hey, cheer up.  World's gonna end in ten minutes anyway.
How'd you get the tape?  Why didn't the cops put it in evidence?
Tick.  Not to dash your hopes, but I don't deal this kind of product, you know that.  I'll give you four for it, cause I've gotta cut off the last bit.  And my customers want uncut.
Give me six at least.  This's a good clip, here.  Gets you pumpin'.
Hey, you're always saying, 'Bring me real life.  Bring me street life. And, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's Technicolor.'
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Yeah, she came by last night. Shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.
About what?
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
Fumitsu.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse?
You're some piece of work, you know that.  Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier.  I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway.  I'm sorry.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Lenny, give them the tape.
Shit!
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
I've got a good idea, yeah.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
Who's Strickland?
It didn't stop you from loving them. Right?  Or understanding them, or being able to forgive them...
Got your ticket?
He's skull-fucking you, bud.  Trying to get a reaction.  Maybe pushing you to do something.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Down the road a piece is the Golden Sunset, the no-tell motel, Socorro's contribution to international relations. The car's just sitting there, no activity. I've had a couple Hispanic officers casing it all day. Want to take a look?
What does the Manager say?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.
Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
You're going to miss it. Pay attention.
An old junker. Like a reservation car. Blue, side door with brown, you know, primer paint. New Mexico plates. A Ford or ah, yeah, a Ford.
How do you feel, Agent
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
Both in the last year. I suspected only someone as brilliant as Dick Low could find these guys.  Look, whatever Daitz told you, nobody wanted to strip Richard of his badge. You have to get close to be good at what he did, the trick is not to get too close.
What did you think of the Suspect Zero theory?
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
Thanks for the ride.
They're all criminals?
I was interested in two things: computers and crime. They sort of came together.
Why did Koessler assign you as my liaison?
Not about coming to see Daitz?
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
That's true.
Then there's the other issue.
Don't confuse what we do with who we are.
And you're working with him?
Suspect Zero is a crackpot theory. You said so.
You're assigned, we're assigned, to apprehend Richard Low, not Suspect Zero. I have to tell you, Mack, I'm not comfortable where you're going.
Kulok.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
Agent Mackelway?
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
I've been reading, hearing about you. I spoke to Koessler, Professor Daitz.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Was I afraid of Dave Koessler? Not likely. I told you, I'd gotten a bit obsessive. It was an opportunity to back off, think things through.  Where's the file?
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
[Lionheart, what happened?]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Let's talk about Zero.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
[You tell me.]
George Sheldon? The second serial killer killed in the manner of his killings. The crime scene profile was never entered into VICAP. At whose request? David Koessler.
I want to go live with you.
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
I believe it's in my file, sir.
Yes, sir.
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
It's over for you.
You've been through worse.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
I'm sorry?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Nikki.
Yes. Like the quiche.
It does.
...not until you book it...
They're out of Glenlivet.
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
No.
Lisa works at the MGM Grand...
Huh?
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
I would love to see you again sometime.
You're a comedian?
Why, you like the duck with the cigar? 
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Well, I should be getting...
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
Yeah, hold on.
Yeah?
What kind of things?
Well that sucks.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Unless she comes back first.
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
There's the rub.
Thanks, man. Sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
No problem.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I don't talk about her that much.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
There are so many beautiful women here.
No, I just promised myself I'd give it a try. I gotta get out there sooner or later.
I'm such an asshole.
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
You miss the pain?
What's he do?
How's it going for you two?
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
I don't know, I don't know -- listen to you. We're gonna have fun tonight. We gotta get you out of that stuffy apartment.
You got it bad, baby. You need Vegas.
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
Vegas, baby!
Whu?
You're gonna screw up our plan.
Double down.
Always, baby.
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
...So give me the fuckin part...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
Please, Tee. I have to use the phone. Sorry, man.
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
Sorry about interrupting...
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
Michelle went for you, right.
Why? So you can beat yourself up? Sitting around in that stuffy apartment. It's just plain bad for you, man. It's depressing. You've come so far. Remember the first week? After she told you? You couldn't even eat.
Don't remind me.
Please. And you're sweating him? You're "all that" and you're sweating some lawn jockey?
Which one?
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
Why, baby? What'd I do wrong?
Is she looking now?
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
The bear's got his claws back.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
America has been good to me...
Don't be frightened.  Do you think I'd make my sister a widow?  Do you think I'd make your children fatherless?  After all, I'm Godfather to your son.  No, your punishment is that you're out of the family business.  I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas--and I want you to stay there.  I'll send Connie an allowance, that's all. But don't keep saying you're innocent; it insults my intelligence and makes me angry.  Who approached you, Tattaglia or Barzini?
Eat it, it's on the table.
How many times did he stay home the last couple of months?
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
We gotta fight sometime.  Let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.
Good for ten men...
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
What was this for?
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
I could accept everything that's happened; I could accept it, but that I never had a choice.  From the time I was born, you had laid this all out for me.
Then why have I become a man like you?
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
...a fine boy from Sicily, captured by the American Army, and sent to New Jersey as a prisoner of war...
You want him to stay in this country.
You must understand that your Father's enemies have friends in Palermo.
Corleone.
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
The younger men have no respect. Things are changing; I don't know what will happen.  Michael, because of the wedding, people now know your name.
You tell us about America.
I know about what you mean!
Ever seen anything like that before?
Mike!  The party starting!
Give them some money and send them home.
Tom, you're the Consigliere; you can talk to the Don and advise him.
Jesus, I don't know...
You start operating, the five families will start their raids again.  We're at a stalemate Sonny, your war is costing us a lot of money.
I've tried calling and writing.  I want to reach Michael.
Will you give this to him.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
He never asks a second favor when he has been refused the first. Understood?
Not all...I needed another four months and I would have had them all.  I guess you've figured it all out?
They're talking to themselves.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
I'm thinking about it.
Can you say it?
When will I see you again?
Oh Michael.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Oh your father just had too many visitors.  It interfered with the hospital service.  The police came and made them all leave just ten minutes ago.  But don't worry.  I look in on him.
I know I'm not the man he was.  But I'll tell you this and he'll tell you too.  When it comes to real action, I can operate as good as anybody short range.
Cut it out.
Go on Mike.
What are you, inspecting the barracks?  You ready?  Did Clemenza tell you be sure to drop the gun right away?
No.  I want things very calm for another six months.
The Corleone family wants to buy me out.  I buy you out.  You don't buy me out.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Is he alive?
It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
Shut up.
It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together.
It's just an undercoat. 
What?
I love jazz.
This is so good of you.
Could we sail to Venice?
No! I've got more than one shirt!
No!
Shoes too?
Get undressed in your own room, would you?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Freddie, do you have something to say?
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Hello, sir.  Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up?
I just don't believe that!
You don't want to, dear. I'd like to talk to Tom alone -- perhaps this afternoon? Would you mind? Marge, what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he'll admit to another fellow --
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Where's Dickie?
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
I don't believe it. Wild horses wouldn't drag Dickie to --
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
You've got Dickie's rings.
I feel as if you haven't heard anything I've been saying to you.
I don't believe you.
It's all true.
I told you! I knew it!
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
Excuse me?
Dickie, Dickie Greenleaf. Hello.
Trying not to be. Trying to jump ship.
Is Freddie in Rome?
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
So -- are you travelling under R?
Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles.
Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private! 
I've been backpacking.
No.
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Don't you put the past in a room, in the cellar, and lock the door and just never go in there? Because that's what I do.
Tom, are you okay?
How was it?
Was who Meredith?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley?
Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse.
No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! And if I could remember which hotel he was staying at -- the Goldoni! -- Tom was staying at the Goldoni.
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Is there a firing range around?
Huh?
Who mam?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Oh, I think he's a wonderful man. Make a great, great President.
I'm a good worker, Betsy mam, a real good worker.
Well, we're all working tonight.
I don't know...
My name is Travis.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Huh?
Late one night. About three. At the plaza.
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
What hours do you work?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
It keeps ya busy.
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Keep it.
Hello, Travis.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
What taxi driver?
This is gotta be a game, right?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, I don't think so.  That's someone else.
No, no, it's alright. I'll have a big Coca-Cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. They last.
That's fine.
She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? But she stiffed me. A real skunk.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
You looking for some action?
Well... I guess so.
What's your real name?
I don't remember.
Do they drug you?
Don't you want to go?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
But you can't live like this. It's hell. Girls should live at home.
I've got something important to do. I can't leave.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
How?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you.  I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I can't sleep nights.
So whatja do now?
Clean. Real clean.  As clean as my conscience.
Physical? Criminal?
Oh?
Here, officer, take me in. I'm clean. I didn't do it. Got a ticket once in Jersey. That's all. Honest, officer.
How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport?
Travis.
Yeah?
I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long.
Real down.
I know.
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Neither do I, I guess.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Stick with Carla.
It's me sir.
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
I.don't get it.  You're going to help me?
Wait.
Mason.  Mason?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much.
You mean,  me?
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
I do.
No wallet, huh?
And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou.
We're gonna try.  Place needs a lot of work.
We've been closed for a while.
But I...
Ernie.
Well...
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel.
I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.
Pete... go home.  Come on, I'll call that girlfriend of yours, what's her name... Sandy?
Here, one of mine.
Do you remember if you were driving a car?  Maybe you went over the bridge.  No guard rail there, it's easy to do.  It's happened before.
Call me... Ishmael?
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
Exactly.
What do you mean?
Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
No, I...
T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war.
Please, sit.
They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
You mean, he was... let go, too?
I already have.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
No.  Absolutely not.
Yes?
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
If you have some, I'd...
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
Miss Daniels?
Is smoking fun?
Oh, I suppose so.
I don't think your mother would like that.
Don't you like us?
Mitch?  Do... do you think they'll be all right? In the trunk? Can they breath?
What?
No, it's Lois!
Try my best.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Mmmm.
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
Yes.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
Maybe we ought to leave.
I don't know when.  We'll see what...
Mother! I'm trying my best!  I'm... trying... my...
Mother, get a rope!
They won't be.
If they are?
We'll worry about that when we get there.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
I started to say... inside...
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
I couldn't ask you to.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
No, I gotta admit this is peculiar.  Did you have a light burning or something.
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
My wife found a bird in the back seat of her car once.
Didn't know how he got in there. Had a broken leg, turned out. Just fluttering all around there. 
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
He won't be back until Monday. I mean, if those birds are for him....
What?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Yes, I see.  About those lovebirds, Miss...
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
What are you? A policeman?
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
Ouch!
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
Can't see a thing.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
Yes, but...
Seven o'clock then.
What?
Oh. That. Rome.
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
Cheers.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
Do you want some mustard with this?
Really? Tell me about it.
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Inland.
What time is it?
You must be exhausted.
Can we turn back?
And he'll talk?
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know.
And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles?
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
Look, Mitch, even if this is true, even if all the birds...
Not if they're starting a war.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
There, Master Fettes.  Sooner than we had expected.  A stoke of luck one might say.
I'm cold as ice.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
At Pennycuik.  I know the inn.  I can be there in an hour.
You're made for a doctor, young man!
I don't think I can go on, sir.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
But you did promise.
Every street singer with a cracked voice gives tongue to that one.
What?
See that, Fettes?
Are you a doctor, too?
Of course -- I don't have friends. That's because I can't walk.  I try to make myself used to it.
I want it --
I will not have you use that name to me.
It might be an interesting case.
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
Why should I be afraid of you? What are you holding over me?
There is much in what I say, Gray, and if you have any regard for your neck you'll leave now and stay away from my house, my school, and from me.
I've ordered nothing from you.
I have other means of sustenance.
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
Believe me, Madame, if I were only a doctor, I would undertake this operation at once.  But I'm more dominie than doctor -- I've a school to run.
And why not?  He's a good lad -- bright and able.
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?
I'm looking for my friends.
You sent them. I had no choice.
Tell her... we'll get him.
What do they do that they had to kill her?
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
You lied at my trial.
I don't know you, man.
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
Wrong. Answer.
What Scar? What fucking scar?
I want Lauren. I want my life back. I want... to know why.
I know everything about your sister. I'll prove it to you.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
It's all my fault. Oh God. I wish I were dead.
It's ok, it's ok...
Guy dressed for Halloween?
An accident, Nathan.
Why are there so many?
That guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about Lauren.
It still doesn't mean...
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
In the hands of a mature civilization, these would not be considered weapons of aggression. But in the hands of your people--  We've observed your aggressive tendencies, and we don't trust you with such power.
I came here to warn you that, by threatening danger, your planet faces danger -- very grave danger. I am prepared, however, to offer a solution.
One thing, Mr. Klaatu. Suppose this group should reject your proposals. What is the alternative?
Such power exists?
The people who came to the meeting must be made to realize this. They must understand what is at stake.  You mentioned a demonstration of force--
Something that would dramatize for them and for their people the seriousness of the situation. Something that would affect the entire planet.
Mom -- why does Mr. Carpenter have to go down to the police station?
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
Oh, boy -- can I, Mom?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Is it different where you've been?  Don't they have places like this?
We certainly did.
The skeletal structure is completely normal.  Same for the major organs - heart, liver, spleen, kidneys.
Perhaps if you could explain a little--
We could call a special meeting of the General Assembly... But of course the UN doesn't represent all of the nations.
Apparently I'm not as cynical about Earth's people as you are.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
Bobby's the only person I know who isn't -- Jittery.
He's a fine boy, Mrs. Benson.
Naturally I think so.
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
Oh -- hello--
What is it you want?
What happened?
You hold great hope for this meeting.
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
I'm sorry.
Well, he's not here. And he won't be back till this evening.  I think you'd better leave now. Unruffled, Klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. He tears off the piece of paper and hands it to Hilda.
No -- no, thanks.
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.
No -- I'm afraid not.
All day.
Salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
Why not?
They're gaining on us!
Good.
Whattaya mean?
That's right.
I'm my own man.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.
You can't kill me, Star.
Bad breath?  Long fingernails?
Gotta keep in practice.  It's a dyin' art.
You like Michael.
See you later.
No.  I'm up.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
In here?
Vampires, Mom!  Everywhere! You've got to tell the police! The newspapers!  The TV stations! They'll listen to you.  They'll believe you...  you're a <u>mom</u>!
This is not a joke.  They know that we know about them.  They're coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
But, Mom...
Say hello to Thorn.
You're cute, Max.
But I don't think it's what you really want to do, is it?
You're thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
I'm really sorry, Max.
I don't understand Sam.  He's just not like this.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
What do you mean?
Ouch.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
I know, I've felt it...
You've got to put this on.
Did you spill something?
Wanna go to the comic book store?
What happened, Michael!?
What??
What about Mom?
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
Star.
How long were you with the dog? Alone, I mean?
What the hell you looking at me like that for?
I've asked him to try and locate the site.  Okay with you?
Don't you understand?!  That Thing didn't want to become a dog...
Have you come across Fuchs?
Why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Was dark... find a light...
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
What's happening?
What?
Not the only one.
Thank you.
Hey, man...!
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
He's dead.
We've got to find Fuchs.  When we find him -- we kill him.
Why?
MacReady...?
... Well, you wanted to see it.
I'm the librarian.  I've always been the librarian.
Who doesn't know the Morlocks?
This is the way in?
What do you mean?
No...
I don't understand.
Created?
And who are you, Alexander?  Who are you to question thousands of years of evolution?  This is the world now.  I am fact.
Why?
I know.
God -- could have killed me -- bad girl, Nell!  How did you know to do that?
You're late.
I need to... um... talk to you.
Talk away, Professor.
A moonstone.
No... let's walk through the city.
My God...
Somewhere around "D+2xy something something."
You know generally teachers are supposed to teach real equations that add up to real numbers.
You may not like it, but this is the world we live in, Alex.  Little grey men with little grey hats.
Emma actually likes chalk dust -- says it smells like me.
You don't know that.  You couldn't possibly.  If I'd only done this, or that, if I'd arrived ten minutes earlier, or later.  If we'd taken a different path or I hadn't fought the man for the ring.  You have no idea what it is to relive every moment of that night -- consider every action you made -- and every one of them wrong.
When's the last time you were outside this house --  -- or this room?
I can't leave when I'm so close.
Good night, David.
Yes!
Most things.  We're very high on purpose.
Oh, it was...  ... Most of the time.
Is it?
You've welcomed me into your home. Into your lives.  Everyone has... For the first time in a long time it doesn't hurt quite so much.  I thank you for that.
Yes, sir, he --
May I get you some --
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
You supported his application, Dr. Philby.  You are his senior, advisor.  I depend upon you to restrain his... excesses.  Any repetition of the behavior I witnessed in his classroom today and there will be consequences for you both.
I want to see your home.  Will you take me?
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
Sir?
What about Starks?
Don't get all worked up, Justin. I expected some common sense on your part and clearly I was expecting too much. [Beat] Just open the drawer.
Well, your condition's pretty serious.
[Beat] So they say. [Off Becker's steady gaze] What?
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
Long live the Organization for the Organized!
It is. But when it comes down to it, you just have to patient with them. They'd rather have their vacation, too, so they just push dealing with our "practices" off to the New Year.
My business?
Getting away with things. Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
[Beat] You're his son?
You just told me. The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket. I'm in it right now, Dr. Becker.
I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
You done with your small talk?
Mom, he just fixed our car.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
I gave you my dog tags.
[Beat] You bled to death.
Do you really believe me?
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
How long do we have?
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?
No, he didn't.
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
[Beat] I don't know.
Why don't you help me?
I'm about to die unless I do something to stop it.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Who told you this?
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Well, how'd you get here?
[Beat] Why'd you stop?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
Hon?
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night.  You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
Honey.  Nothing's impossible.  You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason.  Maybe he was askin' for it.  Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
Lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  Do have any ideas or don't ya? I been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again!
Stop.
What for?
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.
Don't hurt me.  Harlan.  Please.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
What?
How?
I've always believed if done right, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it.  I need that money.  Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back?  Please, I'm desperate.
I know.  Call me back.  Louise, I love you, okay?
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
Does it have something to do with another guy?  Are you in love with him?
You wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
Yes.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
We don't need the lantern.  The place has electricity.
It's Bob's, the day manager's.  He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
How come he let you go?
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Jesus Christ!  Louise, you shot him.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
What did Darryl say?
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
I didn't ask him to come!  It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  You're making a spectacle.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
I want you to call Darryl.
Just past Boise City.
Whaddo we do?
You mean now or before?
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I can see that.
Harlan.
Just the look on his face when you...  ... it's not funny.
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding!  Don't you even...
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
You know why.  You already said.
What'd I say again?
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
What?
Thelma, that is not an option.
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
We can live in a hacienda.
Yes!  Yes!  Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It'd have to be pretty good.
What?!  What d'you think?!
Why?
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
What in the hell is it?!
Where you goin'?
Oh, Jesus!
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.  You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Well why don't you look her up?
Yeah, right.
You're kidding? What did they say?
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Dom? What are you?
So... I see you made the news.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Very nice.
The sawbones?
Same here again.
Are you... an architect?
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me.  Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world.  Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Lint?
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
So...
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
You can't be serious.
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
You're a sick man, you know that?
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
You know, I really should take your card.
Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of salesman or something?
I see where you're going.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
I'm buying bananas tonight.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
What's up, Doc?
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
Oh yeah. Fine.
Oh, are you on the team?
Really? I never got a message.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Sure.
Trying to be.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Go!
What what are you doing here?
Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you doing?!
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that this guy I like was gonna ask me.
Did you have any indication of this from Georgi? Any possible warning or sense of motivation?
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
Well, I'm not.
Somebody had to say it. I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
He didn't have to worry about nuclear weapons.
Where've you been? We've been trying to find you all morning.
Smoke.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
The sun came up today.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
I don't know, Helen. I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow. Leave the T.V. on, sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off.
I want an hour with him.
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.
I don't like what's happening.
We need those flights. We have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.
I don't want to listen to this again.
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Bob, is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first?
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
What's this about?
Who are you?
I'm a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
I did.
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
The right man? Talk to me, Ray.
Alright. Alright...
All I could think of was... not here. I don't wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from home.
It may have been Maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
Jesus, you alright?
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
Why?
You ever put your hands on me again and you'll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades, Mister.
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony?
Maybe you're not aware of this, Crow Horse, but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA fingerprinting; I don't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.
What's he smoke in that?
What did he say?
I don't see the connection.
That's not solid.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Not Native American myths and legends. I'm with the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.
Not no more.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
He tried to kill him twice before. That's a good place to start don't ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn't he?
A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
Your relatives must've taught you something.
What?
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
No way. No fuckin' way.
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
I thought he'd never leave.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Two miles.
Evan... or Maverick.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
You don't have to kill it.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
Where?
You want to go ballistic?
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
You always get what you want?
I'm still second best.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
What do you want?
What kind of games?
What truth?
Yes sir.
Yes, Sergeant?
Can't shake him.
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR.  Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
Let's hope you're right!
What is he doing?
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
This is crazy!
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
Saving them some paperwork.
Gotta go, man.
280, 290, 300 knots.
But I have to!
What do you want?
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
Great move. Great
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
She's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. The noise alone kept me up.
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
Three guesses.
He's a good pilot.
That is all. Tell me about the MiG some other time...
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
You may not think so, but you are.
What happened to them?
What happened to number five?
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
The guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form Hauser...All of that was set up by us.
Come on, Cohaagen!  You got what you want.  Give these people air!
I am Quaid.
What the fuck is going on down there?!
We can't let him run around.  He knows too much.
Who told you to think?!  I don't give you enough information to think!  You do what you're told!!  That's what you do!
Yes, sir.
Eight years.
I see.  Slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Not exactly.  What you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  But you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
Bullshit.  It's all coincidence.
Pull them out.
Yeah.
You're Kuato, right?
Rekall?
Yeah.
What trip?
I don't know.
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
I swear to God!...I never saw you before six weeks ago!  Our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Nice to meet you.
Hauser left me a note.
I'm not falling for it.
Not bad, for a hooker.
He's lying.
Aliens built it.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
I gave you?
What do <u>you</u> use it for?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.
Oh my God.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Don't matter.  They're all the same: dead weight.  Can't make a decision, can't walk because of their shoes, can't work because of their fingernails.  Make my skin crawl!
Oh, Jesus!!
Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Civil?  I'm civil.
Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I'll just be playing this hand myself.
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Well, I brung her something I know she likes.
Come on.  Get away from it!
Rhonda's got an idea about that.
Yeah, they're confused.  They can feel our vibrations, but they can't find us.
Look, the situation hasn't changed. We still have to get to solid rock. There must be <u>some</u> way!
From Chinatown... Which is right up the street from the morgue! Where did you go with the body? What did you do with it?
That-a-boy. Hospital.
The photo on the left shows the bullet that killed Jimmy Chin, true?
Don't hurt him.
I will allow the witness to testify. With the understanding that your questions are confined to the area of Mr. Kim's modus operandi.
Kim's prints were all over it -- He admitted it was his gun, f'r godsake!
Kim denied it. But he admitted the gun was his, and he got life. Seems to have been an okay prisoner for eight years, til the... incident with Duane Lindeman.
-- What?
But what?
Eddie -- it's Art Esparza!
Pardon... Which dialect do you speak?
They're Chinamen who speak English. We call them informants.
Start looking into the Joe Boys -- who assigned the hits in 1980, what rank generally did the hits...  Your extensive law enforcement contacts should be of some use.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
Figures.
Want to tell me what went down here?
-- About what?
No.
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
Y-yes, sir.
We reconvict, your man's looking at 25 years on two counts, served consecutively. So what I'd like to ask, Ed, is: Are you joking?
But now you've strayed from your area of expertise -- dope -- into street assassins. A subject on which you're dangerously ignorant.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
I followed you here from court.
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
Fighting the Aryan Warriors and the Black Guerrillas, basically.
Cigarettes, candy bars...  PCP, crack...
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
Cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. Do you honestly think Cole's practice of word association works?
The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. The world is a hologram, Albert.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Oh, yeah? You'll be callin' soon and maybe I'm not gonna be there.
Don't get funny with me again.
Let's ditch this place and party.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
Well, where are you going?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Right. She had a friend with her. The friend took off.
Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
CHET, I AM CALLING YOU FROM PORTLAND... OREGON.
OK, Gordon.
OREGON. A YOUNG GIRL HAS BEEN MURDERED. SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD. NAMED TERESA BANKS.
Phillip?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
He's dead -- good and dead.
No.
Did she ever mention any friends?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Solved the Whiteman Case with this.
I don't know, Sam.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
Are you speaking to me in a code?
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Oh god, Laura.
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
Where are you going?
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
What are you doing?
Laura, I am your friend.
WE got it back, that's all.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
No "Jacques". I am the Great Went.
James...
What?
Johnny, Johnny... let your Daddy and your Uncle and Leland talk.  Ben... Leland, we can play the French against the Norwegians. What do the French love more than anything?
No.
I understand.
Can I take the car?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
My god, I am going to have another breakdown. God, god.
...school's fine...
A friend from school.
No.
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. Shelly, I know where everything in this house is. Sometimes on the road I mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
Laura just took off. She asked me to do the run today. Should I do it?
What's with that Laura? Yeah, sure, take a look around. There's no one here anyway.
And so what is the rest of his case aside from Dr. Thompson?
This is a nuisance suit. He's looking for small change. He's asking for six hundred thousand and betting we don't want to go to court.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
...here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy...
...yes. Get her on the phone...
Gruber...
This is going to drive the ante up.
What does it mean?
You would not...?
You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
I thought I would need it.
I know of him.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
How old are you?
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.  It's unsubstantiated and we can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
Anything special about the case?
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
...we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
What you thought!? What you thought... I'm a workingman, I'm trying to get my wife out of town, we hired you, we're paying you, I got to find out from the other side they offered two hundred...
Dr. Thompson...?
...I made a reservation at...
I didn't do too well for you.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.
Is that what a good doctor would do? How old are you, please?
Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
Hi.
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs. Simmonds.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
I got a letter from the Judge Advocate's office on you today, fella, you're on your way out... They should have kicked you out on that Lillibridge case. Now this is it today.
What Hotel are you staying at?
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
What...?
I've got to work.
You're talking like a drunk.
I... do you want me to leave?
Is it over?
From the magazine?
Yes. Price...
We get it at work. We get the magazine at work.
I told the guy I didn't want to talk to...
It's locked.
It's not a good case. It's a very good case.
Yes. Yes, I have.
...I understand...
He's not in, Sir.
Are you out of your mind...?
Right.
I'm getting it back. Don't worry about me, Mick. I'm fine. D'you find the obstetric nurse?
Today is Tuesday. What?
I've got to go see Gruber.  What's the best cigars you have?
Rooney's protecting someone. Who is she protecting?
'You guys are a bunch of whores... uh... loyalty... you don't care who gets hurt... you don't have any loyalty...'
...yeah... good...
What the hell are you doing here?
She did?
Yes.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
But those notations stop...  ...Four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
...and he's making a billion dollars every minute working for Stearns, Harrington, and he bought a dog, and everything is rosy.  Then Mr. Stearns, he tried to fix a case.
The Big Boy did...?
Huh.
Before he can get there here comes this Federal Marshal, and Franky's indicted for Jury tampering, they throw him in jail, he's gonna be disbarred, his life is over.  Jimmy, gimme another drink.  How are you?
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Is that it over there?
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
I do know him...slightly.
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
We can't go into town - everybody's getting out of there!  I'll fly you over to Pasadena.
It's gone now.
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
A forlorn hope - but there is a chance.
Right.
Colonel - shooting's no good!
It's always been a good persuader.
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
Number three to. D.O....Number three to D.O.
D.O. to number three..come in.
Better'n a lion farm or a snake pit. We won't have to feed it!
Maybe these are not men - not like us.
I thought you'd killed Freddy off.
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
You mean that was a...
And since you've been thinking of making it.  Has anything funny happened?
I don't follow.
You get any sleep last night?
You probably were half awake and saw me get nicked by that picture glass.  Dreams work like that.  You want me not to go on this job?
Guess so.
Chase.  Why didn't Chuck or Terry show up?
He was just here!
He doesn't have to be awake to be on his feet.
no.
Someone's coming.
Tomorrow night.
And...what's the man doing?
What...what is that?
I'm fine.
Everything went great, I thought.  We really got you, didn't we?
When do you think it'll be done?
Holy...
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Oh, hi.  I'm fine, Sara.  My God, a voice from the past!
That low passed through last night. May be a little bumpy out there.
Looks like weather.
You sound so sure.
A pretty young maiden she happened my way...
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Well, that's all part of it.
Carry on.
How old are you, son?
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
Gieg, Chuck.
Look, meet us out front when you're through.  If they try to take anything away from you like Johnny Quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
I doctored my grades so I'd make the cut.  I'm a moron, okay?  You satisfied?!
I couldn't have done it without you.
Hey, shut up will ya?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.
Spying?!
I'll read it.  I mean I don't mind.
What?  Come on...
Damn, Porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
You've gotta be kidding?
But, they don't speak English.
Suicidal...
Do me a favor and tell Bill once she's dogged down I want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  Lawford, Bill, Mike, John, and Phil will stand the watch.  Everyone else hit the racks.
I have arranged to host a good will cruise for the Dutch students of the local school there.
What are you blubbering about?
Yes.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
I'm fine, thank you. I had a cardiac infarction but I'm on a new diet and exercising regularly. I've never felt better.
This be it?
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
I'm from all over.
Sorry to hear it.
Ready for another?
Don't think about it too long.  You had enough?
What's she doin' here?
Wish I'd fuckin' cut you up good.
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
My name's George Kovich. Bet you've heard of me.
Woman drivin' down the street spotted me with on a roof with my rifle. She called the police and they came over and arrested me. Thought I was a sniper! Boys at the VFW loved that one. Cops didn't understand about the pigeons, the damage they do to personal property. I used to complain to the city but they never lifted a finger. I was gonna put out poison, but I was afraid somebody's cat would eat it. Hell, I had six cats myself. So I used the .22 because it didn't make much noise and the ammo was cheap.
What happened on the charges?
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
But I'm wild at heart.
Hasta siempre.
Gotta admit, you guys are -  two in four dozen.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
What brand'd she smoke?
You're perfect for me, too.
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
You up for that?
You mean like pedal pushers?
They sure do stink.
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
I do.
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
More'n likely.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Oh shit...
Lula, you there?
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
The reptiles were supposed to be of a docile species, said a senior government official, but it seems the breeders bungled and reared attack crocodiles.
Mama???
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
What if I asked you not to?
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Get rid of him?
Yes... Get rid of him.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
Just tell me what you want.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Well?...
Tripp!
I thought you were tinkering.
Trip??
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
I think it's more complicated than that. Besides, he's a little... scattered. He almost... did something stupid tonight. At least, I think so. Anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
His parents.
Good idea, Crabs. Only one problem. I don't know where they live.
I'm afraid he's pretty worn out, poor kid.
So whose car is it?
Do you know he won't expel him?
You peeked, didn't you?
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
You've got a gun, motherfucker. Drop it!
Goodbye, Grady.
It doesn't matter. It only took me an hour to write.
A little.
I put you on the floor.
Want me to get that?
Who?
What'd he say?
Good, James. If the Zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
That's a big book you're writing.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
A couple weeks. That's why... that's why I had the gun. For protection.
It's my father. He gets it from his doctor.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
Kinship. And what's here?
So, why did you take me up there?
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
The hell I am.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
Get out of here.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
Me? Sure. Why?
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
New?
Is the thing -- is it over?
Not have it.
Really? That was fast.
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
Who's that sitting in your car?
Are you sure you parked it there?
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
You don't deserve me, you know.
I'm not sure that's possible.
That's nice. All we have is a Japanese beetle trap.
No.
Where's Emily, Hank?
Well, there's always people you don't know at these things, but I can't say there was anybody particularly suspicious... Wait. There was one guy. Tiny fella. Claimed to be a jockey.
The perpetrator.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
I'll never forget you got me started there.
What's happening?
The birthday party.
Anna will be away at camp. The house will be quiet. It's better when it's quiet.
It's crazy out there.  Young girls wearing mini this and mini that. Sometimes when I walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I'm bothering her. She stares down like she's afraid to look at me. Why she do that? Why can't she look me in the face?
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
You don't know?
I would.
And when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? Is that when you jerk off?
They grow outside, don't they?
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Woodsman?
You don't know?
I could take you downtown.
I'm adjusting okay.
But you are taking it?
Sergeant Lucas.  May I come in?
How come?
It sounds like you were banished.
They sound like finches.
Does he?
It's called sarcasm, Dr. Rosen.
No way.
Is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Is that what you are angry about?
You couldn't say.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
I want to talk about it now.
Remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
Sorry.
I don't know.
Close your eyes.
No, I am not going to --
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
In my bed too.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I don't like nobody behind my back!
How do you feel about that?
Want a ride?
I'm all right.
Very weird.
No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
I like the noise.
They could eat you.
Something happened to you.
Why do you want to know?
Hey, that was... intense.
Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
Do you?
Look, you can go now.
Twelve years in prison?
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
Sounds like a special guy.
Their power. They seduce me.
You're scared.
Don't do that.
Do you want to talk about it?
There we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I'm tool-pusher and we're testing this automated derrick of hers.  So, we get back on the beach and... we're living together.
She-hit.
Benthic Explorer, Benthic Explorer.  Do you read, over?  This is Deepcore--
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
I can't believe you were dumb enough to come down.  Now you're stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
I was worried about the rig.  I've got over four years invested in this project.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
So what about "Michael" then... Mr. Brooks Brothers... Mr. BMW.  You still seeing him?
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
But what did he see that made him panic?
How can I go on a feeling?  You think Coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
You did okay, back there.  I was fairly impressed.
Try again.
I can't afford slack, Brigman.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
God, I hate that bitch.
No, I mean it.  Those SEALs aren't telling us diddly.  Something's going on.
That's Perry.
Hippy, you pussy.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
You boss is having a full-on meltdown.  Guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we're all ringside!
He can still make it.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
Because it's true. After thirty years -- not having ever spoken the truth to anyone, I should at least allow myself to do so with my own daughter.
And have you any other truths to tell me?
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
At what?
Occasionally, but always with affection.
I have no desire to sacrifice myself... It's idiotic to sacrifice oneself... Why?... For whom? If Anna were here I might understand your scruples. But she's not...
Oh, Sandro...
It takes even less.
I think the only way to help ourselves, Claudia, is for us to be together.
Claudia, listen to me...
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
Then why do you say them?
Yes. We'll get married. You and I. What do you say?
But why am I so infatuated with you?
You're that sleepy, eh? What time do expect to get up tomorrow?
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
What do you mean by sensible?
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
I wonder where they could have unloaded the stuff ... Maybe right here at Lisca.
What is it?
Let's see you dive from the top of those rocks, Giulia. That would be really sensational.  Come on, Giulia ... your life is much too circumscribed.
You men are all so dreadful!
It's strange how anxious women are to display themselves. It's almost a natural inclination.
But why me?... Ask Claudia, she's much more beautiful than me.
So? That's logical. You see, both being gardeners, they spoke about you to one another.
I only exchanged a few casual words with her, as one would ordinarily do on a public bus...
Thank you.
You're kidding!
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
As a matter of fact, I've already had several phone calls on that article. One said they had seen the missing girl in an automobile somewhere in Rome. Another one said they saw her on the pier talking with some strange sailors... Could be she secretly left the island by boat...
Yes, but why do you think our readers would be interested in such news now? Even if I sent it, the editors wouldn't print it.
He talked to you Himself?
It's a sin to be fat.
Agnes...
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
I'm being punished.
No.
Yes, Mother.
That wasn't me.
What would you like to talk about.
I don't know.
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
Oh, I know he does.
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Oh, yes.
Would you like to talk about it?
Yes.
And what did you do?
What baby?
Is that where they say it came from... ?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Would you like to ask them?
Do you have any children?
I've stopped menstruating
Does it bother you?
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
Agnes...
No.
Do you believe she really saw them?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Sometimes, yes.
What did you do?
She watches... she listens.
That you're a mistake?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
What?
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
No I'm not.
To help me.
It came out of me.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
And then what happened?
Someone's following me.
She said Michael.
And then... what did she do?  Agnes what did she do?
I put her to sleep.
H... how?
Why?
Larry...
I gave you the pictures Marty, what else do you want?
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Who are you?
Marie's dead Mama.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
The one up on the third floor?
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
Do you still go to church?
I can beat that.
Is that normal?
I haven't a clue.
Was there a priest?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Why do you think that?
From other nuns...  Yes I... I've noticed.
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
So, someone else could have done it.
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
And what happened?
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
The Catholic Church...
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
There's another choice.
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Yes.
There's nothing here.
About what?
She molested her!
Oh God, if only I'd known.
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
Stupid woman... and that's all?
And what has that to do with it?
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
Would you like one?  Huh?
Saint Peter?
Do you think they ever existed?
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.
You're what?
She's been touched by God, yes.
I have a few more questions to ask her.
She didn't want any help.
Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty-five; sure aren't there four of them?
Lay them down.
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
What about all these letters?
All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
And who's this Susan when she's at home?
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
Ringo!
Oh, listen to teacher's pet.
Morning!  Who's that little old man?
Well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Gear?
Thank you.
You don't half slam the door in people's faces, do you? I mean, what about when you're playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
I'm not ...
I bet you don't sound like real people.
We do, you know. We sound like us having a ball. It's fab.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away ... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well ... that's why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
And what do you do about it?
Aye, it is but as long as you get by, it's all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. Anyroad, I'd better get back.
Yes.
Can you now? Aah ... sheeps' heads! You learn more by getting out there and living.
Do you think I haven't noticed ... do you think I wasn't aware of the drift? Oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they've driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
Oh ... I dunno.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
Lip reading.
That's right; convict without trial ... Habeas corpus.
Stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
And another thing, where's that old mixer?
Well we know that but what's he doing here?
He's got you worried, then?
I hope he fell off.
She's going to show me her stamp collection.
Paul, John, George - get at it.
Now, look here, Norm ...
Hello.
Mind you, I stood up for you, I mean I wouldn't have it.
Don't exaggerate.
Where's my grandfather?
What do you think are you're up to?
Do I have to raise me voice?
It's not my fault.
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Yeah, down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
What?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
Eh, what's all this?
I'll set John on you!
So you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
Yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
... I don't know...
I was scanning the horizon to see what I could pick up.  Look there, on that screen.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
What was that Dell, I lost you, do you read me?
What's wrong?
How long to fix?
Hard to say.
Sorry to interrupt, but I'm gonna charge up the engines for a minute, okay?
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
Hurt!  How?
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.
What do you mean?
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
Maybe we don't have to.  It's trapped in there.  We could just leave it in there all the way back to Irth.
We can't pump poison gas down into the cooling unit!  It'll flood the whole ship!
<u>How</u>?
The flamethrower needs more fuel.
It will be.
We can't spare the personnel.  We've got minimum takeoff capability right now.  That's why Chaz left us on board.
Why, you chickenshit bastard --
What's happening up here?
Blow the ship up?
Is it armed?
How far?
Air lock?
It won't come -- it's stuck.
What is it?
I thought I'd find you here.
We can't even radio for help; the carrier wave wouldn't reach its destination till long after we'd died and turned to dust.  We are utterly, absolutely alone.  Can anybody really visualize such a scale of distances?  Halfway across Creation...
Time and space have no meaning out here.  We're living in Einsteinian equation.
Okay.
Yeah, okay. 
Martin, uh, we've found it.
Martin?
Hey, can you guys hear me?
I understand why you did that.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while.
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Now what?
That's a flip-flop gate to channel the air, but we can use it to trap the thing.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
Kill me...
That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...
How many of them are there?
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Where're they headed?
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
How much air-time have I got?
Deal.
It's alright, it's cool...
We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
Compensate!
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
I'm going to need you to co-sign the report.  Until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
'Bout five minutes.
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
You take charge.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
Some plain soda.  Lloyd must be expecting a record run in New Haven...
You have no right to say such things!
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
There never was, there'll never be another like you.
What do you take me for?
What have you got to do with it?
So does the history of the world for the past twenty years. I don't enjoy putting it as bluntly as this, frankly I had hoped that you would, somehow, have known - have taken it for granted that you and I...
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
You have a point. An idiotic one, but a point.
In my case it's necessary. Too many taxi drivers write plays.
Dear Margo. You were an unforgettable Peter Pan - you must play it again, soon. You remember Miss Caswell?
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
The audition was called for 2:30. It is now nearly four.
Naturally enough, your understudy.
Of course I knew.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
Margo, as you know, i have lived in the Theater as a Trappist monk lives in his faith. I have no other world, no other life - and once in a great while I experience that moment of Revelation for which all true believers wait and pray. You were one. Jeanne Eagels another... Paula Wessely... Hayes - there are others, three or four. Eve Harrington will be among them...
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Huh?
Right here. A minute ago.
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
The reading could have been better, but you said it - now "many happy returns of the day..."
I love you...
Outside of a beehive, Margo, your behavior would hardly be considered either queenly or motherly!
I thought you were going to be late-
I ran into Eve on my way upstairs; she told me you were dressing.
So she seems.
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
Then what would be enough?  If we were married?
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
Groom-  - may I have a wedding present?
What would you like? Texas?
Why.
Is it the money?
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
Don't run away, Bill.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Oh, brother.
Kill the people.  Got your key?
Well?
Night an' day.
She thinks only for me...  ... doesn't she?
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
Don't be dense. The party.
Miss Harrington...
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
How long does it take?
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
Addison wants me to play it.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
Back to Copacabana. But Eve. Margo, let me tell you about Eve-
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
How much time have we?
Do you want it on?
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
About what?
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
Now let's not get into a big hassle-
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
Where'd you get all that information?
If - instead of waiting until next season to do 'Footsteps on the Ceiling', which is in pretty good shape - and if Margo can be talked into going on tour with 'Aged in Wood' - we could put 'Footsteps...' into production right away...
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
- well? What happened?
Would you, really? How sweet-
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
When you do, let me in on it.
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
You have a genius for making barroom brawl out of a perfectly innocent misunderstanding at most!
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
It this Templeton 89970? Miss Margo Channing?
All you got to do is name it.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
But what could she do?
It's OK; I'm sorry I called you a failure.
Hmm.
--what do you think?--
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
--see?--
--fifteen phone calls--
And?--And?--
This is terrific work, if you like rejection.
--The L.A. Times has a huge interview with Baldwin--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
He'll give us a sworn statement.
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
What's the matter?
Woodward?
--what time is it?
I'll never get out of here in time.
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
Any idea what he did?
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Well of course.
Can't help you.
--that was awhile ago--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--
There's always a later plane.
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
But I want you to know that I understand why you're afraid--a lot of good people down there at the Committee are afraid. I'm really sorry for what you're being put through.
...No... never in so many words...
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
Who by?
--if we wrote a story that said Haldeman controlled the fund?--
You saying the Democrats bugged themselves?
How senior?
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
...you're definitely doing a story...?
I don't know; I really don't. The last time I saw it was when I was in Washington. I gave it to the Finance department of the Committee to Re- Elect the President. How it got to that burglar, your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
I hope you noticed how coolly I behaved under the threat of discovery.
There were more then.
Fifty ratfuckers directed by the White House to destroy the Democrats?
--you've done worse than let Haldeman slip away, you've got people feeling sorry for him--I didn't think that was possible. A conspiracy like this-- the rope has to tighten slowly around everyone's neck. You build from the outer edges and you go step by step. If you shoot too high and miss, then everybody feels more secure. You've put the investigation back months.
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
Who's Charles Colson?
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
I can predict the next words you're gonna say: "anyone but Bernstein."  I want to send a reporter to Miami.
I don't get it--you were the one who wanted to fire him.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
More denunciations?
What else have you got?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
Sorry, coach.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Me too.  For the most part.
Yeah.  Right, uh-huh.  I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me.  Music is so expressive.
Of course, I didn't --
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
What?  No I'm not.
I wasn't making fun of you.
You talked to Stifler?
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  I really have no idea.
I know.  Salt and pepper?
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
This isn't any better, Chris.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
I think I've had one.
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
That's stupid.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
Hey Sherman.  Scopin' the babes.
You did it.
So you need to change, right?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!
Strip?
No, not again.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
I think "shithead" really says it.
You want to do it?
But you don't love me.
You comfortable?
Yeah Vick?
That was a great night.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Then she said -- she loves me.
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
I'm such a loser.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
That junior chick?
<u>Yeah</u>!
Merde! Just missed!
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Serafine...
Are you okay?
I know. He told me.
I hope they fucking fry us all.
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
The ADM. Let's go.
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
What about me?
Andy...
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Why would he pick this one?
Not that I know.
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Okay. So he's weird. Maybe on drugs. Still, that's not -
Andy!
What've you got?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Why were you so late tonight
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Poor Meetoo!
Fortunately, I am to be married.  With your highness, permission.
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
It's the best fork of all
Don't you, child?
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
So, I'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can I say, I struck out. I thought chicks would like the fact that I can talk, you know but, I mean, the way things are going I couldn't get invited to a plague.  Someone's gotta clean that up...
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Trust me, it's her!
How do you know?
I sent for you because I owe you a debt of gratitude larger than I can ever repay
You are the boy ...
Rasputin!  You're alive . . .
Come on.
This guy's on television! Alvy Singer, right? Am I right?
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh?  They-they they're laughed out.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Oh!
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
You-you play... very well.
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
Oh - you're an actress.
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Uh, you're driving a-
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Huh?
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
No, I got time.
Duane?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
Here, you want some?
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Oh, yeah.
You are extremely sexy.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
You- Do you love me?
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh? 
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
You're so sure about it.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Whatta you mean? Me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Two?
Okay, okay. Okay.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
yes, we had, uh...
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
Christ!
Yeah, this place is great.
Thanks, honey.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
What'd I do?
Why couldn't you have been more like Donald?  Now, there was a model boy!
Commentary.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
My head is throbbing.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look-  there's God coming outta the men's room.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
Max, the city is terribly worried.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
V.P.L.?
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
His wife has diabetes!
She was going through my pocketbook!
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Oh.
Yeah.
A triumph.  When did you get here?
You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor.
Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out?
Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
Scratch the two, write in a four.
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You look so well, Clair.  A wraith.
Escape hatch.
Harry called.
And?
But she's alright.
We live next door.
Oh yeah...
Go.
Hey!  Would you?
Give him a minute, Clair.
We closed.
Well, you're a tower of support.
He's directing now.
You're out of your mind.
What?
No.  Did you?
We're great.
Otis!  No barking!
Yes.
Okay, knock it off.
Dolphins.  Great.
Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away.
Otis!!!!
It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done.
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
It's not like this all the time.
And how hard it hit?
Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second...
You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do.
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I know.
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron?
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
Don't be silly.
Do I put you off?
You manage to throw me off balance.  I adore you.
Ours.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
I meant Sally.
Sally did all this herself?
Uh-huh.
Easy tiger.
Scout's honor.
Would you sign it for me.  I'm sure this is inappropriate.
I need to leave you now.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
Of course it's alright.
Jesus Christ.
I don't need a drug.
You're not serious.
Excuse me?
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
Hi.  Monica and Ryan?
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich?
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Shit.  It's my Galiano.
I don't want to talk about it.
Alright.  Well, that's something new.
No.  Not something new.
I don't mind...
Enough about me.
So where should I put it?
I thought it was okay where it was.
A notch above the storage room.
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
Don't try and change the subject.  Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
You weren't exactly horrified.
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back.
Why are you doing this?
Someone who follows his heart!
-- At the <u>worker bar</u>!  You were pretty hot to trot then!
Excuse me, I --  Pardon me --  And they call them social insects.
Of course!  It defines society!  To deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
I was <u>slumming it</u>!  I danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
Worker!  Come back here now!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Out here I'm just what?
Hlllllllp!
Yes?
So...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
I mean, I've got the whole package, right?  A great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
You did?
Well, what exactly does our platoon do?  Serve beverages?  Process paperwork?
Barbatus, hang on -- Barbatus!!
Desperate times call for desperate measures.  Get me Ant Team Six.
Yeah...I mean...well...I don't know, really, sir.
May I cut in?
Ask me why we're so successful.
Why are we so successful?
You see?  Being an ant is being able to say, "Hey -- <u>I'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
I don't know what you're talking about, Z.
Hey, did you hear what he said?!
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
Eggs he asks me for. Oranges. What you need is a good horse-whipping.
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Sheldrake?
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
Say, you got a lulu.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Really?
What time does the show go on?
How come?
I forgive you.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
I think so.
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
No -- I don't want anything.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
I mean -- her apartment.
Your stomach?
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
No doubt about it.
Sure.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
I would.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
I know so. He's a taker.
No, I don't.
Where?
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
I see you bought some napkins.
I never thought he'd do it.
Oh.
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
I'm fine.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Good evening, Mr. Baxter.
Last night?
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Sir?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
How do you work it with the key?
Yes, sir.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling.  Tell me something,  Baxter  -- have you seen Music Man?
How would you like to go tonight?
Relax, Baxter.
Yes, of course.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Sir?
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
How's that again?
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
What's the matter with Miss Kubelik?
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
I know.  Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so?  You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice.  Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you.  I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
Hi, Doc.  Had a late call?
My body?  I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed.  Good night, Doc.
She going to be all right, Doc?
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
I'm not sure.
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
Where are you moving to?
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
No.
Not so rough, honey.
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Dreyfuss.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
You know I liked it better long.
I missed you, Fran.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling?  You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong --  Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy.  Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now.  This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
I'm sorry, Jeff. You know I could never hold my liquor --
Hey, Dad -- why don't we put a fly in the nose cone and see if we can bring it back alive?
We need all our fuel anyway.
I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked --
Which part is that ?
Were you Longe Range Recon --
I didn't know we had units up there in North Vietnam.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
Flood.
The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out.
Shot himself. What for ?
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Anybody see some smoke ?
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Our Recon flight ?
Touchy.
You want me to clean it up -- simple and quiet.
Terminate ?
Yeah, it still runs.
It's to everyone I really knew -- the first girl I screwed -- my brother -- best friend -- I wanted to tell 'em how much I enjoyed knowing 'em -- it's been a great twenty years. I gotta let 'em know.
What're you askin' me for -- put 'em in the first helicopter comes in tomorrow.
No, sir.
We don't want to bother you any, we --
A habit of men of war, sir -- you understand.
Upriver? Why upriver? There is nothing there, only jungle.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Change.
Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left.
I got bored in Saigon.
What's the furthest you been in?
When did you hear?
Who knows.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
Who?
Do you know me?
Do you?
Yeah, I like it...
How did we get here?
I'm gonna get you out of here.
You get to know each other pretty well out there.
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
Want to say goodbye to the Colonel?
This one , Lance?
You think he'd of shot us?
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.
Why did they attack us?
But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.'
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
His name is...
Cognac?
That strange things.. terrible things have occured around this American, Kurtz.
Yes.
What show ?
23   CONTINUED:
134  CONTINUED:
27   CONTINUED:
Six months.
The radio's on the fritz.
Why?
Was there any trouble?
It's exactly what you meant.
Be careful, okay?
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
Ice is too thin -- you can see the water moving underneath.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Stay still.
Don't judge me.  You're a joke, coming here from a fucked-up culture, telling us what to do!
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
Emergency transmitter?  What happened to signal mirrors or two-tone smoke fires?
Lets us watch each other's backs over a wide area.  Only thing messed me up this time was getting arrested in the baths. ELT was in my duffel bag, not around my neck where it should've been.
Why offer a buyoff with your gunmen waiting outside?
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?
I'll get loose before that plane comes.
Sure.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
I was just on my way to your ladyfriend's, but I guess she found you.
I should release Corbett because you want some votes?
Go easy.
Thought that door was open last night...
...Ben never sent a signal.
Meaning he'll need a plane.
Closest planes for hire are here in Cache.
This is Sam Wilder, Marshal in Devil's Cauldron.  Had some killings here.  I got a suspect; be real nice if someone came and took him off my hands.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
What is it you want? What?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
Yes.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
I'm starving.
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
Yeah, yeah...  any chance you'll get back to work today?
What needs clearing up?
I'm not kidding.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
No... no thank you notes.
What's that got to do with it?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake.  I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Sex with Simon?
It's one idea...
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
That seems like a good choice.
Okay. Good-bye.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
No!!!
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
One night with me!
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
She's nice.
What?
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
Ask him.
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Do you realize that I work at him?
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Where are all your queer party friends?
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Come on, sweetheart...
That's very thoughtful.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
That somebody out there knows what it's like to be...  in here.
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Why are you doing this?
No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Where you from?
But they caught the guy.  I heard it all.  Sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  Shooting anybody.  Drugs, probably.
Sit back.  Put your seatbelt on.
What's your name?  We both know it's not Nicholai.
You don't have to tell me that. It's just, I know my bid was low, but was it too low?  I mean, did I seem like an amateur, like I didn't know what I was doing?
Five million dollars?
That's right.
You would be.
How in the fuck do you know that?
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Because he is trying to retire me.
If you walk out that door, Bain will still come after you.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
You were like a boy genius?
Tell me about the first time.
You said you didn't trust it.
Do you think about the game?
But you've never figured out a way to win.
Not even a stalemate?
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
What happened?
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
Why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
She is married, but not to him. Another man, much older.  She has four kids.  The young guy works for her.  And I think she likes kinky sex.
And you were drilling these holes...?
Apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
Attraction is a complication?
It can be.
Someone like me, like you.  A pro.
No.  I tried to stop it.  I couldn't.
I waited another four minutes.
Right.
I'm taking off my mike.
For what?
A dime.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
This will take some time.
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
What about that squat bar you showed me, is that open on a Sunday?
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG  until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
I don't know man, I'll drink beer and shoot crap with you anytime, but this is different.
Well, don't get carried away.
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
I thought you were gonna throw these?
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
We could make a start on the floor afterwards.
Holly!
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
Lucky break!
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
It was a condition of getting Doug out.
No, by road?
There shooting at something.
We should be done by the weekend.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
It's just talk, he's drunk.
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
No.
I thought for sure they would catch me.
Sure, I've done it easily.
They'll do it.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Seems a shame!
What's the Bugler?
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
We had a deal!
You bastard!
What are you an idiot!
He wants to show now.
To see your father?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Don't call him a dipshit.
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
What is that?
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
The dirty snowball at its core.
My relationship with God is my own.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
He okay?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Before we do this.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
Where?
What would you do up here?
What'd you tell your father?
Ergo?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
No.
Help me live until I die?
Anything you want.
What are you thinking?
I've talked to your father.
But if you could, you would?
By accident --
No.
It was a play.
I'm asking how much.
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
I care for her.
So talk to us about something.
How about your family?
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
You have materials for the side bearings?
I helped Jamie with the first one.
You've been well?
Now I can do what I want.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
This is 1952....?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
You remember me...?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
Maybe if I used my left....
Not a holocaust --
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
You're the only Mr. Lewis in this class.  If you have something to say, say it so the whole class can hear.
Operator...
A mall?
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
Then I would have figured out to get back in through the events in the natural course of history! Don't you understand? The fabric of history is very delicate. Anything you do could have serious consequences!
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
My guess is that she turned him down.
Apparently, what has happened is that the maternal instinct has transcended the gap of time and this has caused an alteration in your mother's emotional behavior.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
You didn't?
Thanks for everything, Pro.
...He just lets himself get pushed around all the time! People walk all over him and he never fights back, never stands up for himself.
Catch!
Kit... Maybe I'd better get a shovel.
What do you feed him?
Well, it's not good enough.  Just what do you think would happen to her if she stuck around with you, Kit? Guy like you.
No, you're not either.
Yeah? Why not?
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Okay.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
Spanish.
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
I know.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
You know what I think?
I came in the front.
Are you sure?
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
This your place?
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Not me. No way.
There's another one we owe 'em.
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
What crate?
Not really.  This is pretty important.
Everybody ready?  How do we look?  Do we look okay?
What is it, Tommy?
Who?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Hell they don't. I met my first wife that way.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
That's why I wear a fifty dollar hat.  Was a two hundred dollar hat, I hadda kill you.
Is, uh... Is he okay?
Please, Barton.
...Who is this?
Well... THIS.
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his  what about before that?
I'm sorry, I just feel like I know I shouldn't ask, I just need some kind of help, I just, I have a deadline tomorrow-
I'm a writer, Mr. Geisler. Ted Okum said I should drop by morning to see you about the 
Sure he did. And he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
He's a great writer 
To do what?
It's about what I'm writing, Garland. It's really... I think it's really big.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work 
Doesn't surprise me at all.
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people  that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need  a fella could do worse.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now 
Well ain't that a kick in the head!
...I don't guess this means much to you.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
You're all right, Charlie. I'm glad you stopped by. I'm sorry if  well I know I sometimes run on.
Sure, sure Charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
Howdy, neighbor.
That's all right, really 
Hi, Charlie.
Jesus, what a day. Felt like I couldn't've sold ice water in the Sahara. Jesus. Okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. But God, people can be rude. Feel like I have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
...I guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
Barton. Are you all right?
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
Mr. Fink hasn't given a preference, Mr.  Lipnik.
Excellent picture.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
There's no smoking in this building.
I can get my butt kicked for this. You're not supposed to be in here.
How about the booze?
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
What are you doing here?
Don't!  I know about your husband.  You still like girls, Beth?
Did you leave the club with him?
I told you -- I quit.
You like playing games, don't you?
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
Why take the risk?
You're in over your head.
Did you like her to watch?
About three months before I met you.
What about the other night. What about last night?  Was that to get to know your character?
I found Lisa Henderson.
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
Was she ever a suspect?
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
I don't know.  I'm just not.
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Fuck you, Phil.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
We know you're not stupid, Ms. Tramell.
Naa..
Saddle River, New York!
Yeah... Like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents.
No.
You name it, I paint there.
Who did this?  Who did this?
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 
Decipher?
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
I use a lot of colors  not only black.
Yes, yes... Let's talk about that.... your roots... Your father is from Haiti, isn't he?
Who said that?
Why, that's from Time Magazine.
Are those the only two possibilities?  You wanna French fry?
Who am I?
Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate.
Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
What's the rush, John Henry?
You do! You definitely do.
Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.
It looks done.
Hi.
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I'm really excited.  And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
You did it! You made it. I'm a painter, too.
Some of them.
Wanna Mac?
I don't eat junk food.
No, I don't. I'm alone. We all are. Especially here. The world's unjust. The respect fools get. The disrespect I get.
Hey, Rene.
I didn't know.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
I need this?
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
Well ... Come what may... Merry Christmas, Mr. Wayne.
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
I think you're jealous that I'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
What went wrong?  Hang on, I think I know ... You kept things from her.
Guess I'm sick of wearing masks ...
... What do we do?
But who could've ... no, don't say it.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
Sidetracked?  Oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
Reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
I don't.  So, no.
Why, how industrious.  And how did you open protected files, may I ask?
It's our secret.  Honest.  How can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
I'm sorry, Uncle, I came to tuck you in.  And...
I'm sorry.  I was too late.
Oh, but, sir.  So much goes on-
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Specify, please.
Street racing isn't exactly an acceptable major at Oxbridge.  They kicked me out.  it doesn't matter. I've won enough money to do what I've always dreamed.
Crimefighter's rule number one: never say that.
You're loosing your cool
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
This is all about fashion for you, isn't it?
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.
What are you talking about?
She knows who we are.
Forget the stars.  Look here, at the Earth, our mother, our womb.  She deserves our loyalty and protection. And yet you spoil her lands, poison her oceans, blacken her skies. You're killing her.
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
We gonna trap ourselves a snowman?
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
You'd say anything to keep me away from her.  To keep her for yourself.
In my weakened state I am no match for the bat and the bird.
Trust me.  Vegetable magnetism.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Forget your frosty femme.  These lips are wet and ready to get frostbite.
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
What do you mean?
Our work?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
Maybe they're right.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Why's that?
We all wear masks.
I haven't had much luck with women...
I see without seeing. To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What am I?
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
What do you know about obsession?
Look, I'd love to keep chatting-
Like normal folks.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
But...
You could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. I think he felt it too.
And now....
I don't want to remember!
What does it say? What hurts so much, Bruce? What does the book say?
...I missed Two-Face by a heartbeat. When we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
You can't-.
Who is it?
Paranoid? The psychotic?
Yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  It's so you.  And yet so _you_!  Very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. But you pull it off nicely.
How high up would you say that is?
Mr. Wayne is out for the day.
Where's the boy?
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
... How long have I been out?
I loathe bats.
Is this what you wanted?
Bruce Wayne.  -- I've read your work.  I quite like it.
"This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant.
Do you want a drink?
That's a tough one.  Have you ever seen combat?
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
No one would miss me.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Finding out where she is.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE --
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
Five stories, straight down. There was no blood in the body.
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --
... Thank you.
And you want a --
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
The guy's bats all right. He's bat shit crazy. He --  -- I can't believe it. I was right!!
HOLY SHIT!!
Ali?  What's wrong?
Excuse me.  Mr Grierson called down. He's ready to see you upstairs.
What happened?!!!
She's ... well, she's good.
Yes.  Ahm.  I was just wondering where my English house guest had got to.
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
... you have to sack me.  I understand, sir.  I'll go quietly.  In fact I'll go right now.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
You've known me five years Elmer. When do you get to calling me David?
Who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
... in the distant future.
It is urgent, sir.
Shut up, Kevin.
You know, Mr. Bean's okay.  You're not gonna kick him out, are you, Dad?
Yeah, but check it out. It's gone!
No it wasn't!
Actually, we just wanna watch TV...
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
Ow! These chips suck.
Me first.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
Huh? Huh huh.
Huh huh huh. Settle down Beavis.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Butt-snatch...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Aaaah. TeeeVeeeee, heh heh.
Just make sure it looks like an accident...
Oh, maybe you're lactose intolerant.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
Cavity search...?
What the hell...? Bork! That bus we picked up. Where was it headin'?
Okay, boys and girls, our suspects are on a tour bus we believe to be headed for...  the White House! Jumpin' Jesus! I want everyone there. Our people. Locals. Orders are shoot to kill. Repeat! Shoot to kill!
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
Cool. Huh huh huh.
Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
No, Jane.
Adam my booyy!  When you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  My buyer has just made a killing in condos in the Village.  And he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
Get <u>away</u> you little monster.
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
That's how long you were gone.
God, it's Jane Butterfield!
Won't?  Or can't?
Just says 'won't.'  Wait a minute. Here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
Arrogant.  That's Jane Butterfield all right...
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out there.  You don't know --
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
My God, we're back where we started.
God, this is so corny.  Have we been reduced to this?  Sheets?
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need help.
He might have hurt somebody.
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a businessman.  I'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>Beee</u>tel <u>Jooose</u>!  <u>Who</u> do I gotta kill?
<u>So</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? Even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
Are you available?
Hell is other people.  You obviously don't read much. Besides things seem pretty quiet here.  You should thank God you didn't die in Italy.  The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been studying the manual?
You lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
How'd you do on the science test?
And live in what, our station wagon?
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh. Listen, cookie, I've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  All I want is to get out.
You've got to help them.
He's a cloven-hooved beast!
Why not?
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
I <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
You read my <u>mind</u>!  I love clients who can read my mind.  I don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
What do you think?
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
I understand. I've seen it done before.
It's good that there was no apparent damage to the bone.
However, with injuries such as this, I have run into minor hemorrhaging, which really isn't too serious at the time, but can cause secondary problems if not looked after.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
... He's gone, Chauncey.
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
I see.  Mr. Franklin, I must ask you and Miss Hayes to keep this incident with Mr. Gardiner to yourselves. There's no telling what he was involved in, and the matter may be extremely confidential. So please, not a word.
Oh, Mr. Gardiner, I've been looking all over.
Oh, yes.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
May I ask your name?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Yes. I lost my remote control.
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
He does...?
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
What is that?
Our greenhouse.
Hello, Eve.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
I know...  ... So are you, Chauncey ...  ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that...  ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
... Is that all you want...?  ... To watch me...?
Hello, Mr. Gardiner. This is Sid Courtney, Washington Post.
Of course, Mr. Gardiner, the fact that you occupy such a position in the world of finance makes you ideally suited to provide our millions of viewers with an explanation of this nation's economic crisis.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
I agree.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
Yes, Ben - he is.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
I like to watch.
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
How long do we stay in here?
... That is a very small room.
Good morning, Louise.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
Well, ain't that the truth...
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'...  ... gotta go now, Chance...
No. I don't object.
Yes.
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
I live here.
... How long have you been living here?
Since you were a child?
How were you paid?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
No, I do not have any of those.
Then how about medical records? Could you give us the name of your doctor, or your dentist?
1952...?
I'm fine, Thomas. The garden is a healthy one. There is no need for a claim.
But you won't sign, correct?
As long as the roots are not severed, all is well and all will be well in the garden.
Sid, it's useless!
No headaches?
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached...  ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
Good evening, Mrs. Rand.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... How are the kids getting along?
Huh... I'm glad they're along with her, if you know what I mean... How about Jack?
... What do you make of all this?
Look, Johanna...
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh...
We have word that the Soviets have put out a top priority alert for information on Gardiner's background. So far, they haven't come up with a thing - what's more, as a result of their eagerness, one of their ablest agents blew his cover, we have him in custody at this time.
Good. Anything else?
A coup d'etat! Of course, that was foreseen by Lenin himself!
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
Well, Ben... I...
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
Morning.
Is the trial date set?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Seven-ish
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little.  I'll be in soon. A little while.
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
So how was it? What was he doing?
No they're not.
What about Maxine?
Yes.
We?
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
The monkey.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid I have no idea what you're saying right now.
Money, Miss Warts?
I said "yes."
I am a trained performer.
No. I understand perfectly.
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Emily Dickinson.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
I'm right?
What'll you have?
Yikes.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Sure. It'd be fun.
You're evil, Maxine.
Let him try.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest, I didn't anticipate this.
Right, Lester. I heard you the first time. I'm not a dummy.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Count me in.
Why not? I need to get in there!
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
I'd love to see your work.
Sleepy suddenly.
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
What world are you talking about? Ain't nothing harmless down here.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
We have to be steady. "These things too will pass". What you looking for? A miracle?
No. Sorry.
Baby, don't be like that.
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
That girl...You know, Beloved...
Well, if you want my opinion...
I don't. I have my own.
What you want?
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
Extra?
MAMA!
Out where?
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Might see anything at all at 124.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
You planning to do anything about it?
You don't know what I think.
You shaved.
She comes in the daytime.  She still with me, my Denver.
Oh, I don't have no plans. No plans at all.
Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the tenth.
They called about eighty minutes ago.  They want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. One person only or I'd go with you. They were very clear on that: one person only.  What happened to your jaw?
Shit.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Hey, man, I'm not--
The?  Who the fff--
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
Nothing.
Yeah.
Don't need it.  We're scattering the ashes.
Yeah Walter, what's your point?
What the fuck is he talking about?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Who has your undies, Walter?
That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes, taken when--
Far out.
No, they--
--smoking thai-stick, breaking into the ROTC--
And was there anything of value in the car?
In the briefcase?
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off manually.
Of course, there's that to discuss. Refill?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
Is that what that's a picture of?
He fixes the cable?
Thousand, yes, bones or clams or whatever you call them.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Well--yeah, I guess--
Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be responsible for any delayed after- effects.
I was, uh, one of the authors of the Port Huron Statement.--The original Port Huron Statement.
Oh?
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Jeffrey--
But your father--he runs stuff, he--
But he's--
What's the point of--we all know who was at fault, so what the fuck are you talking about?
So who--
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show dog with fucking papers.  You can't board it.  It gets upset, its hair falls out.
No, you're not wrong--
What the fuck is going on there?
Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These guys are fucking amateurs--
Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say peep when I'm doing business here.
The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!
Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch I roll out!  I double back, grab one of 'em and beat it out of him!  The uzi!
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
They kept saying they believe in nothing.
And let's also not forget--let's not forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city-- that isn't legal either.
Yeah.
The bulk of the series.
And the fucking money!
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
Shit yeah!
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude, he kept the money, but my point is, here we are, it's shabbas, the sabbath, which I'm allowed to break only if it's a matter of life and death--
You're fucking Polish Catholic--
What the fuck are you talking about? I converted when I married Cynthia! Come on, Dude!
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war whereas, uh, this thing should be a fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, eyeball to eyeball.
What's mine is mine.
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--
Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this, and I know it wasn't your fault, but I just thought it was fair to tell you that Gene and I will be submitting this to the League and asking them to set aside the round.  Or maybe forfeit it to us--
Shit!
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla usted Inglese?  I'll say it again. Did I urinate on your rug?
It's funny.  I can look back on a life of achievement, on challenges met, competitors bested, obstacles overcome.  I've accomplished more than most men, and without the use of my legs.  What. . . What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?
Fuckin' A.
WHAT?!
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
<i>You'll</i> take him.
You're hurt.
What about Nomak?
Thank you.
Why?
Your security's for shit, kid.
What's your problem, Whistler?
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Must be hundreds of these skeletons here.
What's going on?
Listen, hillbilly, you are a cunt-hair away from cowboy heaven.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Whatever --  What'd you do to the Charger?
Where'd you dig up this shit-bird anyway?
The hell are you fiddling with there?
Tweaked the phosphor rod, modified the collimated beam, wanna concentrate the light, get something like a UV laser going.
Going on twenty years now.
Going somewhere?
I don't buy it.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
This is an old tongue, from an old world. It concerns LaMagra.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
What are you looking at?
What do you see here?
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
How long have we been driving?
Get out of here --
I'm not leaving without you.
You're a week early.
But you -- died --
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
What happens then?
There's no need for any of this. Your condition can be treated. Whistler and I were working on a cure when --
What -- ?
Who are you people?
You've been listening in the whole time?
Whistler!
How did you escape?
On me, yes. On Blade, I'm not so sure --  The problem is, Blade didn't contract the vampire virus from a bite like I did. He was born with it. The irony is, I could probably cure every vampire but him.
'Give you a hand. I think my sleep for the night just ended.
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
What're you doing there?
Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
No!
Let's talk to your husband--
Shit? This is from "Josh's Blair Witch Mix," man!
--Christ almighty--
--how old?
Oh, sorry, right.
Cheery little place.
Jesus.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
That's a sapling--<u>this</u> mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
Let's just leave it at: it was one hell of a surprise.
I think we get the gist.
I'm not going anywhere, 'til--
I want to see something!
Whatever you want.
Absolutely.
--hours before--
--last thing I remember were those four clowns shooting the movie--
Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
What? That made her lose the baby?
--thank you, Heather Arendt--and arend't we glad you're here--a real witch--
--which'd be about ten bucks--
What the fuck--??
This is her equally on-the-rag boy- friend, Nick Leavitt--
--they're from UMass, doing some kind of fucking term paper--
We're not making Blair Witch II here.
Cotter?
This isn't about us.
How're the cameras doing?
--what happened to the goddamn "Witch-watch??"
Oooh. Oooh.
Dad...?
No big deal. I'm just trying to understand.
Gothic rune--the letter "S."
What happened to my Dad??
Yes.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
See a guy.
I could've sworn I heard something.
...Huh?
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Thanks.
Ray?... What time is it?
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
...Where is everything?
...So?
I own the place.
Tell him the channels, Dusty.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?
...You know that car?
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
You want me to kill 'em.
...There's a big--
Dead, huh?
Red Label.
The point is we don't serve niggers here.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Thanks Meurice.
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Come into the study a minute.
Jeffrey! Come on in.
No. not at all.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Yes, but.
Don't say PLEASE, Fuckhead. WHAT ARE THESE?
Can I feel 'em?
Oh he forced you, huh?
GET OUT OF THERE!! GET OUT!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name?. WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
Jeffrey.
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Tell me what you saw tonight. TELL ME.
. I saw you come in, talk on the phone. get undressed.
Nothing. Are you alright?
Yes.
Then don't talk about killing.
Hi. can I come in?
Nice guy.  Who's he?
. or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
They hurt his head.
Who, Dorothy?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
My father is watching the businessman. The businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. They think he's been murdered.
Yeah, I guess so.  What are you going to do now that you're home?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
Are you sure?
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
You want a Dairy Queen?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You want to go talk to him?
Maybe. But I think the Yellow Man is on drugs. I think Frank supplies him.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
You worry about me really?
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!
Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
My father has a gun at home.
For good?. I can't. Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
He doesn't know you're out of school. He thinks it's a vacation for you.
What?
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
No.
Mrs. Williams? Thanks for the cake.
Oh, you're welcome. Nice to finally meet you, Jeffrey.
Five-thousand per kilo.
Nothing like this back home.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Surprise.
Tuna, this is crap.
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Mr. Jung, you're a convicted felon, correct?
What?  Yeah, sure.
I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
Why are you speaking?
Because if you are, you have to tell me. If not, it's entrapment.
What the fuck is that?
You?
I want my kid out of protective custody. Now.  No fucking around.  My wife and my kid on a plane tonight.  I sign when they call me safe and sound.
What?
What do you got there, Diego?
And that's wholesale.  Cut it a few times and retail, you're looking at two, three-hundred thousand.
I don't know.  A hundred, hundred and fifty.  How many miles is it from Colombia to Miami?
How are we doing?
A million dollars for our first run is not bad, George.
Bad news, George.  I'm in Colombia.
I'm calling it three.
I'm married, George.  Me.  I can't believe it.  Can you believe I'm married, George?
Cocaine?  How much?
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
It's a family heirloom.
Yes.
Yes.  I do not know, either.  What do you want, George?
Beautiful girls?
George, you look terrible.
Just low.
I just don't know what you're thinking. I don't understand your choices.  You know, the police are looking for you.
So, business is going good.  I've got this import/export thing going on in Miami that's been very profitable.  With my investments...
Figured what out?
What the fuck are you talking about, man?
Source?  What about Derek?
Hello.
I don't know.  My name is George.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.
Pablo said no?
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.
Yeah.
Hey, George.  You okay?
Mirtha, how are you doing?
I don't know.
How are you doing?
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Yes, he's sitting right there at the end of the table.
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
Yeah?
Smith.  Hampshire....
I can't believe we're stealing a plane.
Third group.
Third group. What's your assignment?
Why are you afraid? We've always been friends. One might even say that I brought you up ... Isn't it true, Ali?
Sure. By shooting at me.
But I haven't shot him.
I don't do that kind of thing.
And how many are we?
It's better to split up, to increase our chances. We must change hiding places, and change them continually ... In the meantime, we must make new contacts, replace our arrested brothers, reorganize our sections--
What do you think of the strike, Ali?
It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
What is she saying?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Yes.
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
Objection!
Her name?
Rebecca Lawson.
Yes.
For about one year.
I had bypass surgery.
She didn't.  She just left.
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
What eventually happened to your relationship with Miss Lawson?
We stopped seeing each other.
What did she say?
She said that those weren't any good -- because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim had been poisoned.  She wanted to know if there was a drug that would induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual high.
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
High school?
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
Who told you that?
That bastard!
Yes.
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out.  Why do you think he did that?
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money.  That must have made you pretty angry?
Yes.
Three fifteen.
No.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
Frank!
Something like that.
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Why not?
That's not an answer.
Hi.  It's Frank.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
Yeah.
You lied to me!
That wasn't the deal.
Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
No.
Why didn't you come to me?
SO!
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Nobody did.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
They got heat in Michigan.
Are you from Washington originally?
Oh, that's nice.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
About a year and a half.
Feeling better?
Why did you stop?
I'm sorry. That was...
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Smells like dirt.
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Yes.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
I had a temper.
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
STOP IT!
WHY?
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
Yes. And I've accepted.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
I'm going to miss you.
Want anything special for dinner?
Betty.
Apparently just before her death.
Well, she was very specific. She wanted her ashes to be thrown over Roseman Bridge.
Why don't you hang on and I'll see if she's here.
Is it true?
Can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
Looks like a damn graveyard round here.
Wh-wh-whooo?
Those 'fools' are my people.
I said, no thanks.
Don't need luck tonight.  I'm just letting 'em have their say before I say no.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?
Jimmy, you've got --
Where we'll always be...
They get about twelve and a half minutes. Tops.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
...I've seen things.  In there.  Last night.  You did too.  Don't tell me you didn't.  You were crying like a baby.
no really, let us help.  We're new in the neighborhood, gonna be neighbors.
How do you know?
It's alright.  If you want to go home...
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
That's the past.  It's dead.
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
You're right.  One of my associates sold the building last month.
That's a Bozo no-no.  Jay-bird.
Nice rack.  How old is --
You was just doing your job.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
12-year olds.  They scare easy.  Anyway, he's gonna tip their stash.  Come with me.
We got a gift for you, Eddie.  Fresh new BMW.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
We just thought...
That's all we did, steal their ride.
But the place burned to the ground.
Just admit it, Caesar.
The money!
We know how this was done, eh?
Sit down, Gino!
No, Caesar, gimme the gun.
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
Caesar, this is Corky.  Corky, Caesar.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
They were early.
They just left, didn't they?
What?
It's impossible!
He didn't see you, did he?
I need you ...
Caesar, this is crazy.
Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
I can use Johnnie's car, dump it in Lake Michigan ...  I need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
Don't tell him --
Violet!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
Yes, I understand.
You know he would have done you, too.
How's it going tonight, fellas?
You're helping Rajeev?
How many'd you do?
Where is it?
Why?
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
I knew it.
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
I had to see you.
...  I needed that.
The redistribution of wealth.
I'm already in your bed.
Because it's the truth.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
He was in love with you, right?
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
Yeah.
It's in a case, on his desk.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Gino Marzzone.
What happened?
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
Where will you be?
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
I don't know what we're talking about.
You're asking me a direct question?
And what if I couldn't do that?
<u>This is an operations desk</u>.
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
Forget it.
We don't know what we're into!
Treadstone?
What is Treadstone?
So now you know.
We'll make you better.  We can put the pieces back.  We can do that.
Keep it. 
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?
Yes.  Is he there?
You are a friend of his?
Yes.
I'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to Paris.
Great.  You know what?  I'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before I start screaming my head off.
Nothing.  It's just not there.
Okay, so you're a victim.
Looks familiar?
Okay, so...
Look, I don't know what's up there.
This is your office?  God, you live like a monk...
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is Zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
Who paid the bill?
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- Miss Kreutz, please --
-- I'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the United States government -- me -- I'm the one being ripped off!
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.
<u>Where am I</u>?
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
...your ducts?
Mumble ... Tuttle ...
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
Layton.
In fact, killing people -
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
Thanks very much Sam.
Yes, you've got to get me out of here. I've got to find her.
Problem? - No problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, Alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I'm on Security Level Five now, and Mr Helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, I feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
Even later.
Yes, thanks.
What?
I don't want to take up your time now, but I was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. It's a security level three matter and Information Retrieval records says to refer to you.
Layton! Oh shit!
We suspect him of freelance subversion.
{baffled) I don't follow you.
Let me try to get to her. I'll deactivate her.
Of course. We went to school together. You're my oldest friend.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Do you know what you're doing.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
How do you think I feel? You shit!
No.
What?
We've got both.
They'll be there waiting.
You're joking.
Oh God! What have we done?
"And your children all gone."
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
Where are you going?
Don't do anything silly.
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
It's not the machine. There's a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... Ah there we go! That's a B58/732 when it should be a T47/215 ... Tuttle ... he should have £31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not Buttle.
Can I forget it?
You want to take my console into your office?
You haven't switched it on.
I won't be held responsible.
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Mother? ... What ... what's ... you've got to help me ...
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Hello ... hello ...
My I.D. cards.
I got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I'll fire you tomorrow. I promise.
You know each other a long time?
Never. No cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
What about Kanita?
Dead.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Okay, what happened?
No. He's dead.
IB Bangin.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Even when you say the things, there's always more things.
She should go home.
You look so different.
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
He's better.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
You married?
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Backup?
I'll drink to that.
I quit! I'm through!
What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
He was tough. You did all you could.
These are hard times, Tom.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Why?
Okay, whatta I do?
If he sees me, he'll run, so I'll get out here. You start talking to him about baseball or something while I sneak around behind and get down and you push him. When he falls we get him.
Believe me, it always works. The simpler, the better.
What?
I'm so stupid. I had beef lo mein last night. I can't eat the same thing two nights in a row. It's almost two o'clock, what the hell am I gonna do? What you getting?
What?
Well why didn't you say so?
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Yes.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.
What's wrong with it?
Wait.
It's not loaded.
Hold it down, okay?
He excels at gratitude.
Yes.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Of course.
Well, whatever you think.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.
Do you feel good about it?
No.
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Your hair's a little funny.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
Just a few questions?
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Just when do you start, telling people?
Well, darling, if it gets any better than that, I'm going to have to bring you up here to New York.
But thanks.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
What did he say?
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
That's okay.
What if we just don't tell them anything anymore unless they let you do the story?
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will you sign it, please?
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
So he was indicted?
I've got another story.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Nervous?
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
Well, what is it?
Nooo.  Is it your story?
No.  Were you going to you?
Because you're nuts.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I just might.
Listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
Nice night out...
Why not?!
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
Well I was uh, just looking...
People seem to like my cat.
Go home.
A show..how soon can we go?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
I'm trying to reach Lieutenant Beldere...
You like chasing the dragon, Walter?
Telling you what?
Who's the head honcho!  Who's providing the smack connection!
You are?
You're gonna shoot me!
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Are you done with these?
Maxwell.
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
I won't say good luck, Walter.
I get it Walter.  I get it.
You don't have to do anything!
Gee.  Thanks.
I don't think this is gold.
You reckless imbecile.  This place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
Well, um... litter?
Yes.  Definitely.  Definitely. Please, God.
You think?  Split?
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
Wait a minute.  What's wrong with you, man?
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
I'm hungry.
Yes.
Hi, Buffy.
Come on, what was it?
I do?  I guess I do.
Didn't you get my message?
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
Will you guys shut up, please?
Yeah, we're drunk.  We're the Drunks. What's your name?
Not exactly.
Well, stay here tonight.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
Three weeks ago all I thought about was... well, I didn't actually think about anything.  I definitely didn't expect this.
Pike, I don't think you're up to this.
Come again?
But, Buffy, you're the guy, the chosen guy.
Are you okay?
Guys, what's the sitch?  I'm bored.
Look, a lot's been going on.  That's what I wanted to tell you guys about. I need to tell you.  You see... a while ago, I met this guy --
Yeah, whoops I came.
What?  Oh.  I used to do gymnastics. Are you looking for someone?
What are you talking about?
None of your business.  God.
Just for protection.  You won't have to do anything.  I just need you to watch.
Meet me at this address after school.
They can't come in, right?  Unless you invite them.  Is that true?
Why do you keep saying that?
But you enjoyed it, yes?
But you threw a knife at my head!
And you caught it!  Only the chosen one could have done that.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
Buffy...
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
I can't work this.
-- like she's gonna kill me.
Don't worry, Jennifer.  Someday your prince will come.
Yeah, just make sure you do first. Let's go, guys.
What's happening?  What do you want?
Oh, baby!
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?
Okay, let's go.
Omniplex?
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
I really was way way too too.
It's amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
All right.  Take care of yourself.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
You said "Crash".
You can learn to like it.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter?  We better not fuck.
What'd he say?
Yep.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
He' s confused--
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
Why not?
Jose Galindo.  He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year.
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.
You a God damn witch?
No, that is not belief.  That is desperation.
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
What do I got?
You been in the Majors?
Naw...
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Go for it.
I was great, eh?
I love winning, Crash, you hear me?  I love It.  Teach me everything.
You're a great catcher.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
Where's Ebby?
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
Jesus--what's got into Nuke?
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
Nuke's overthrowing tonight, he don't look loose.  Anything bothering him?
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
What?
You were never my guest?!
That's right.
Liar.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You were wandering around.
A powerful man.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Watch it, partner, watch it!
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
I'm gonna get a knife and cut you loose, honey, I'll -
When did this happen, honey?
He bet like a fuckin' brain surgeon.
Okay, Sammy.
You mean, I have your permission?
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it.
All right, fine.
All right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, she comes to see me. She was upset about a lot of things, especially that whole fuckin' Diamond - that Lester Diamond incident.
All of a sudden, you're the shoulder to cry on? Did you at least tell her about your little role in that whole situation?
No, I didn't. What good would that do? That's not the fuckin' point.
I - I would appreciate it if you'd stay out of my personal life, okay? You wouldn't like it if I did it to you.
Your fuckin' head is getting' bigger than your casino. That's your problem, pal.
I don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nick.
No? You said I'm bringin' heat on you?! I gotta listen to people because of your fuckin' shit?! You're ordering me out?! You better get your own fuckin' army, pal!
I -
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
You're makin' a big fuckin' spectacle of yourself.
You never - ?
Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy.
I just told you. She called me.
I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know...  She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
Sammy.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
She didn't know who to turn to.  She... she didn't know where to turn. She was tryin' to save your marriage.
Hey, house is doin' well.  Hey, all that money is rollin' in. I appreciate you takin' the time to see a poor ol' civil servant.
Uh, I come here personally to kind of smooth over a fracas about a certain matter. See, uh, maybe you didn't know it, but, uh, Don Ward is a very well-liked man in this town. He's got lots of friends here. Now, his family and their money go back many, many years. Now, friends vote... family and money votes. That's important to me... and you. And if you'll think about our little problem along them lines...  and you forgive me for sayin' it, maybe he did not deserve to be fired.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
You go and put your things away.
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her!
You've got to stop her.
Legally, she can't take that stuff. Legally, she can't take the stuff.
Why is she eight pounds over?
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
Mr Rothstein... well, sometimes, when you reach that pressure point, when you put that pressure point on them, you know, it shows...
Right away. Okay?
I-I'll do it.
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
...she took care of the valet parkers, the guys who could get you anything and take care of anything.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
But as much as they loved her...
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
You can trust me.
You didn't have to beat him up!
That's all you care about.  You don't care about me at all.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be?  Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me.  Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I -
We had a deal. Remember that?  He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
What do you mean?
Right.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
With what?
With the money.
He needed some clothes.
He wanted a watch, too.
Here. Here. Is this enough money?! Huh?  Will it last you two fuckin' days? Take it, greedy bitch.  Take the fuckin' money you fuckin' want.
What did Jennifer have?
Oh...
Just wait there for me!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
I won't let her in. I'm sorry, Randy, I'm not gonna let her in. She - Well, I'm not gonna let her in, the way she's behaving. I'm - I'm -
- you could put 'em on your expense account?
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
Yeah, okay.
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
I really think you're overreacting in this whole -
Listen, you fuckin' yokel, I've had it with you. I've been carryin' your ass in this place ever since I got here. Get your ass and get your things and get out of here.
I'll regret it even more if I keep you on.
That was nineteen years ago, and they were simple gambling pinches.
No, Sir.
Is this yours? Your pen?
Yeah.
I didn't give 'em the m-
What expenses?
Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes?
Yeah, that works out.
Yes.
Well, I've been busy. 
Mr Rothstein. Mr Rothstein, I'm sorry. We've got some complaints about - about the noise.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
I did - I didn't -
Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great.
Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'...
...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know.
It's instinctive, you know.
Yeah. Everybody's talkin' about it. They're makin' a big deal out of it.
I always tell you the truth, Remo.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
I'm positive.  Remo... things are very fucked up down there, you know?
I'll be right out.
Tell me.
I can see that. Sure.
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
I do.
Yeah.
I didn't.  I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
I did what you told me to.
What about my money?
Thank you. Very nice.
I'm sorry.
What money? I've seen you stealing from me.
Yeah.
Do you know that?
I just talked to him.
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
You know why, right?
Get up.
I actually turned my bedroom into a bank vault where I kept the choice stuff.
She asleep?
I took care of everybody.
I know. I know.
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Get out. Get out! Get out!
No more fuckin' dirty work!
I'm positive.
Do I hear a motion seconded?
Hey! Oh!
Oh, sorry -
Since when do you talk like that?
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
Hi.
Cactus, I can't believe you just said all that...
In women?
Guilty. I am.
How heroic of you...
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
What little boy doesn't...  My God...it's, it's...Catwoman.
What's the matter?  What are you saying?
Selina, did you make it home, all right?  I tried calling, but your mother said that there was "no extension in the Hut." Whatever that means..
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
She has a real spirit.
She has reason to be suspicious..Doesn't she?
Selina, are you okay?
You were right all along--the two parts to a person are the reality and the lie.  I was making good money as a top architect--but that's not who I am. I'm not an architect, I'm a..
Not now, Mammoth. Adonis is right. We've had a good run here--the protection kickbacks from the crime syndicates, the merchandising scams-- Tomorrow night we have a big, violent, complicated and lucrative mission to pull off. We chould be resting up.
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
God-damn..
Car wash, Captain?
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
I don't know what came over me.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Hey, architect--she's joking. Right, Selina?  Selina?
Some reporter I am..all this time my story is right there in front..I have a lot of questions.
What if I say I'll go out with you, so you can have all these great daydreams, but then never actually talk to you again?
You're late.
I hate it when you let your hair just hang like that...you have such pretty eyes...
Mom, not now!  I, I don't know what to do..
What's it like being a superhero?  It must be frightfully exciting..How did you guys all get together?
I don't see anybody in there but you.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
What are you doing on Theo's line?
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
What if they do question the authenticity?
Say something ...
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
I know where it is.  Give me that phone back.
Now that'd be a misdemeanor.
Or relieve me of it later.
Can you make him stop!
He's seen both of us now.
Don't fuck around.  Pop a cap in him.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry to do this to you.
Where'd they take you to?
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
Sometimes I paint.
I'm afraid if I stop talking I'll lose you.  Just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
Lenore, I'm here.  I'm getting out.
She's gone --
You said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
The one in Brentwood.
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.
It's not hard to do.  I do it all the time.
I've got a lot of respect for you too.  For the way you feel about your family.
Why tell me this?
What did you do?
She's a child.  She might panic. She doesn't know me.  She might not come to me.  She might just run.
Rachel -- Oh my God.
They put their hands all over me.
Tell them I'm keeping what's left. I earned it.  I probably killed some poor bastard for it.
I don't hear him moving around anymore.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You wouldn't --
What's happening?
Sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
Just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  No harm admitting I fell in love with the sound of you.
Turns out you did me a favor. You're looking at a rich man.
You can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land Jack there in federal prison.  He can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
She's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  But nothing makeup won't cover.
It's your call.
We're waiting on you.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
Stop the crying.
You researched me.  You know where I live.  She'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
Probably as close to the Getty as I'll ever come.  Unless you care to be my "patron," Nels.  You wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
Who were you talking to?
Them.  They won't be expecting us.
I'm in awe.
If you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
Hold on.
Let's have your name and address. The government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
So can we consider you a regular, sir?
He's what she should run a mile from.
How?
Stop it, Dil --
Jimmy.
Look, I'm sorry.
Do it on your own time, Paddy.
Not in my experience.
Who?
Not me.
Perform?
How different?
But you can t stay, you know that?
Shouldn't you be in mourning?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?
You mean that?
What is this?
I'm thinking of your man.
Give it over, Dil --
I said stop it.
Make it up to me, then.
Know what I didn't know. And don't call me that.
Probably.
Am I becoming repetitious?
Come on.
You gonna tell me why?
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --
Shouldn't be, Dil
Yes.
She from Scotland too?
So it's true, then?
You heard what I said, Dil?
What?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
You killed my Jody?
Got to be somewhere.
You like me now, Jimmy?
Then say it.
Yes.
Will I see you again?
The Metro.
You know her, Jimmy?
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Hey -- what's he like?
Horny bastard.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
I know.
Yes.
No, what is the thing?
And then you'll leave her out of it?
And what if I say no?
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
It's nothing. He's just got a sense of humor, that's all.
I'm a volunteer, am n't I?
He's at home.
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Whoever hits him'll be hit, if those men are any good. And I presume you can't get in.
What do you mean you can't?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
What is it now?
They won't let him die.
What do you know about my nature?
Didn't look like that to me...
See? I was right about you.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
Having a pint in the Metro, and Dil's having a margarita.
My special friend.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
See if she's all right.
I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Like the one about the frog?
Take the hood off, Fergus --
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
What you say, faster?
Used to run the mile, you know -- four times round the cricket pitch -- what was that game called?
What?
Who gives a fuck.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
Have you no feelings, woman?
You're crazy --
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
Oh!
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
Where's that airlines bag?
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Reggie -- stop!
But I didn't kill anybody.
Reggie -- listen to me!
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
So that was it.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss --  -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you?  Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
Ours.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
No.
No, what?
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
But no one actually saw him die.
Yes -- ?
Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
Yes.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
Not my room!
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
Scobie?
Would you like to see my passport?
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
Yes, but we're divorced.
What are you doing?
You did.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
Why?
A) It's always the person you don't suspect; B) that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C) if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
No -- not yet.
Why don't you shut up!
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
What do you mean?
I don't believe it.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Forty-five thousand.
A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps.
Mrs. Lampert --
But his mother --
Yes.
Is it all right?
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Yes, but we're divorced.
Now you're angry.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
I don't think I follow you.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
How do you shave in there?
On the street where you live.
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
How do you know what they're doing?
But what?
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Yeah? What's that?
He should. Four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
I never fucked Rod.
If I'm so all-used-up Ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
She's my daughter, Tom.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
is there anything you do?
Hi honey.
What's wrong?
Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
I thought you'd be pleased.
No I wasn't.
No!
We're seeing all the signs in town.
Did you warn her?
Really?
You gave me a 'D'.
I am.
You aren't going to the party?
You could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
You are 'sp fucking' wrong.
He says he loves me.
Cut it out.
I got to get home.
Three of our classmates are dead. That's not really the occasion for a party.
Did Sharon say no?
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
I do not.
I'll think about it.
And when I finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
Thanks for coming back for me.
Hi mom.
Mom?
What?
Did he say anything else about her?
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
And the police did nothing?
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
You're so beautiful.
Aren't you worried you could die a virgin?
If sheep don't count.
Stacy?

Let me put it in easy terms, Aristotle. We are carrying a damn bomb...
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
Oh...
...-ty.
Look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
...moron.
What did I say?
...ya?
I need your truck!
Are you kiddin'?
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
...the ice cream for money!
I ain't playin' that.
We can't push old Pete in this heat.  He can't take it.
...-damn!
Shut up.
Take your gun!

Don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! They still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...you.
You wanna hit me?
 

Back up!  Back...

You can just bend over and kiss your crazy ass goodbye, buddy! 

I know the likeli-...
Ho, ho...

Oh, Pete.  Oh, shit!  Oh, shit!

No.  Shit.

You're not dangerous!  You're crazy!  I ain't gettin' in this damn thing!
Come on!
No!
Oh, no!

Worth a try.

I remember him.  Got in a car crash or somethin'.
Anyway, about ten months ago, I wound up in Jerome, workin' for Darlene.
I mean, if that gun was...
Are you all right?
Put your hand in my pants.
Oh.

Go!
...on!
Forty-five seven!
And Brynner's right on...
...tunnel!
Whoo!
Forty-seven.  You'd better floor it.
Unbe-fucking-lievable.
 

 Vitelli! Vitelli!
 There's gotta be...
Why'd you stay behind?!
Right.  You damn skippy.  And now that I am both jobless...
...-tiatin'.
We're worried...
I got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
This country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.
And it won't be pleasant. 
Wait.  This town is full of trucks.  Nice new trucks.  You don't need to go...
 Eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
You-You can't let him...
You got a prob-...
...-lem too?
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Any of them Richard Long?
Yes, sir.
And I changed the schedule.
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
Mm-hm.
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
Well, Lieutenant Vitelli.
Good to see you again, Leo.
As soon as I heard Elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
...I lost all my squeamishness at Leav- ...
Knowing you, Brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! You're not gonna use that...

Hit him again.

...-ther orders?
You know the suspect?
That's right.
...-fall.
...gear?
Is this your establishment?
Iced coffee.
I assume you want that to go.
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
...should be right outside.
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...


 ...checked. 
You'd never understand!
I would've in another life.
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
...he's smart enough to get you...
...somehow. 
You got thirty minutes.


Excellent.
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...is death.
And what if it does?
You're the only one I can trust.
Yeah, I just....
Well,  Costello's finished with the stability profile, but Abbott is still chewing on the load file.
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
...you, Mason?
Where are you now...
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
Got that?
So you don't remember...
...public drunkenness....
...stole a truck under arrest.
What happened to Colonel Brynner?
...we're all gonna die in this...
But that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
Well, then, how about a ruler?
It disturbs me, Mr. Gittes. It makes me think you're taking my daughter for a ride. Financially speaking, of course. How much are you charging her?
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
No. She's probably scared to death.
Sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. I let 'em practice up out here.
She's fine.
Haven't the faintest idea.
And that's what you were going to do in the Valley?
Two hours... tell me, will Evelyn be there as well?
What are you talking about?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
I'll pay the rest next trip. We only caught sixty ton of skipjack around San Benedict. We hit a chubasco, they don't pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
Thanks, Mr. Gittes.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
Sure thing.
Where's that?
Plus what I owe you?
Then what'll you do?
Summer colds are the worst.
No?
How do you happen to know her?
Isn't that your number?
Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
I heard it was an accident.
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
It's too late.
Mrs. Mulwray, you don't want to run around like that.
Lou, she will kill you. Let her go for now. You don't know.
Get him away from her. He's responsible for everything. Get him away from her!
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
A private investigator?
What are you having?
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar?  Lemon?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
Looks like you went quite a distance.
I can't tell you.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
I'll stay.
Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
Your eye.
I saw him.
You saw my fa... father? When?
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
You mean she just found out?
There's no time for you to be shocked by the truth, Mrs. Mulwray. The coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. Just take my word for it. Now I want to know how it happened and why. I want to know before Escobar gets here because I want to hang onto my license.
Katherine.
Yeah... where are you taking her now?
I think I got something.
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
Shut the fuck up!  ...Yes I remember nothing, Miss Sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
Well I never expected anything to happen like what happened to Mr. Mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out I want somebody to know I didn't know what would happen.
I understand... if you could tell me who employed you, Miss Sessions. That could help us both.
The obituary column?
Miss Ida Sessions again. She says you know her.
He never even kids about it.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
I don't understand.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Yeah, a little runoff. Where are those orchards?
Yes...
The L.A. River?
Yeah.  Do you have any references?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Mr. Mulwray, please.
Yes. No.
He owned the water department?
How did they get it away from him?
Mulwray? I thought you said Cross owned the department.
They were partners.
What are you doing here?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure.  Hope springs eternal... 
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
You weren't expecting me?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending. 
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Toto, this is no film for the common herd. One day'll be more than enough...So tonight, please set up tomorrow's film, so the projectionist who is coming will find it ready.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
You don't really think so?
Well, I went down to Atlantic City -
Yes -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
I'm not guaranteeing a thing, Mr. Bernstein.  You people work too fast for me!  Talk about new brooms!
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
There is no news big enough.
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter.  It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
No, Mr. Kane.
Almost two to one -
I know that, Emily -
I know it is, Brad -
They won't do anything to Junior, darling.  Anonymous letter writers -   I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
You're very easily amused.
You're getting farther away all the time.  It's a duck.
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
Half past eleven.
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be.  I was once.  Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm going to leave you.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie.  We've said everything that can be said.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
"Enemy Armada Off Jersey Coast."  You know you haven't the slightest proof that this - this armada - is off the Jersey Coast.
Oh, yes, sir.
The "Chronicle" is a good newspaper.
Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
Yes?
I don't have to.  I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that.  Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece.  I've got to think of her.
Why is she leaving me?
There's no reason why this - this savage personal note -
Are you finished?
Sorry, Mr. Thatcher!  What the kid needs is a good thrashing!
David, Grobleski & Davis -  My dear Rawlston - 
That must have been love.
Sure.
I want you to stop all this nonsense, Jim.
Where do I sign, Mr. Thatcher?
Charles, my name is Mr. Thatcher -
You can go on asking questions if you want to.
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
Monday, with some of the boys from the office.  Mr. Rawlston wants the whole place photographed carefully - all that art stuff.  We run a picture magazine, you know -
She's just not talking to anybody from the newspapers, Mr. Thompson.
Are you sure?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
Fifty-five.
We're not moving! We have a right, a constitutional right, to assemble and be heard!
You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite.
There's no light back there.
Well, there are, but for some reason they stop working at five-fourteen every night.
Such a sordid state of affair.
When did you get back?
You saw it?
Was I right?
But you were.
Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean?
You lie.
I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed.
Jesus, you're caustic.
Good. Stay in that frame of mind.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
Where'd he go?  I'd have thought he'd be at your side, like an obedient lapdog.
Who doesn't?
Promise me it'll always be like that.
I can pass!
If you grab a Gatorade, then everybody's going to grab one.
You're late.
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
I'm a firm believer in the philosophy of a ruling class, especially since I rule.  Is the Pelican flying?
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom."
Your mother.
It takes different strokes to move the world.
I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.
I'm talking to myself here.
No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?
Blasphemy.
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
I guess.
And you figured it out?
And the second time around...?
What's he looking for?
Why not?
He didn't mention it when he called you this morning?
So, what-you're stuck here all day?
Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.
Sorry.
He's blunt, but he's got a point.
Jesus.
You hardly knew her!
Stop it. This is beneath even you.
You hate people.
She was pretty young, hunhh?
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Reach what?
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.
Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose?
Her fucking body fell out!
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
What's that for?
May I be blunt with you?
You're happy?
You're kidding.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
She said she did all the work.
This life?
What responsibility?
As if it's that easy.
Am I right or what?
You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.
So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?
Why do you say that?
You get my slapped with a fine, you fight with the customers and I have to patch everything up. You get us chased out of a funeral by violating a corpse. To top it all off, you ruin my relationship. What's your encore? Do you anally rape my mother while pouring sugar in my gas tank?  You know what the real tragedy is? I'm not even supposed to be here today!
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
You wanna grab something to eat tomorrow night... after I get out of here?
Just the paper.
You know him?
I still remember Caitlin telling us about that time you two went to that motel-the one with the mirrors and the hot tub in the room.
I don't think so.
Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized.
I am not.
Yeah?
Oh man! Hey, you still going out with her?
Go open the video store.
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
No; he was probably just resting his eyes.
What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller!
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
Aw, c'mon boy. What's the difference? You said yourself the stuff that's there now is rough.
At least they weren't lit.
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
I don't know-like two-thirty, three.
I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.
How flattering.
Now, making a woman cum... therein lies a challenge.
Do you know how many different men I've had sex with?
No; who were the three, besides me?
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
I want you to come with me on Monday.
He gets off on it.
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
No, but you sucked enough dick!
A few?
Thank you for being rational.
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes.
You open?
Scumbag. What are you doing?
Nothing. Just hanging out with Silent Bob and his cousin.
Does he sing in English or Russian?
Feel that.
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
That's the price, my brother.
Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Like hell you are!
Twenty bucks?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Hey, Jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
It can't fly in this weather.
Go on, fetch.
Glad you could drop in.
I love you, too.
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
She's losing it!
Well you were wrong! It was your weight on the line that did it--
Nice and easy...
Do you see them yet?
The ledge, I know it well, or should I say <u>we</u> know it well.
Yeah, we were caught in a storm. I went up there an innocent climber...
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
Why are you yelling?
Okay, but if you do I'll have to perform resuscitation--
You come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  This was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  I can't leave.  You can stay with me, and believe me, I want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, I can't do it.  And you shouldn't either.
Like I said, I can't turn it off.
What if he can't?
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?
Looking for Hal.  Oh my God, I heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
How'd you get up here?
Take off and meet me at Eagle Cave.
Just kidding.
Where's the helicopter?
No, he's gone.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
He asked you, how far?!  I think you've been taking the scenic route.  How far from here?
Who's going with you?
You're looking at him.
Now I have jurisdiction!  I said get your weapons.
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by Ludwig van. Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw. Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
I've been cured.
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that out to us. He said it was a very good way.
Good evening.
Of course. Food alright?
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
Help me, sir?
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?
So this is the young man?
Thank you very much, sir.
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex. He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?
It's alright, thank you.
Do you feel that way now?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, Georgie Boy.
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, sir.
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You can rely on me, Fred.
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have arranged a little surprise for you.
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
I wanna be sick.
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Yes, sir.
Do you mean Church of England?
Fair hair, sir.
No, sir.
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me what you think about them Alright?
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.
Righty, right. The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a peacock.
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength shall be diminished.
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've shown a genuine desire to reform.
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to thy soul.
One shirt - blue, collar attached.
Carry on, Chief.
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what Will the English says.
Moloko-plus.
You psychic?
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Listen to me!  Just listen, okay? There's a man, Vincent, he's coming to kill you!
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.
Can't say that I do.
As a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I'd like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  Twenty five percent.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
Advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. Nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
Cabbie drove around all night.  Three people got killed.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Joey Cicerno.  Dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, Ivan Petrov.  Both of whom were in bed with Dmitri.
It's nothing.
You couldn't pick up a phone?  I'm lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
He's not paying you one cent!
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
Yeah?
Mind if I time you?  What do I get if you're wrong?  A free ride?
It's home.
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
You always stutter?
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
Try harder.  I'm gonna count to three. One...
What?
You better?
58th and Central.  You know it?
Oh.  Oh, no.  You're kidding.  We...
Are you breathing?
Get rid of 'em.
Please.  Don't do anything.
I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
I need the job.
I had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  Where's the button?  Under the dash?
Vincent?
I never learned jazz.
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
What happened?
Gimme your wallet.
The man who hired me for this contract.
Why me?  Why don't <u>you</u> do it?
No.  No way.  I can't do this.
Fifteen years, although I prefer the term "assassin."
I don't know.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
You had to kill Heller?!
Some living.
Head towards Union Station.
You're going too fast.
Max?
What happened?
Any special reason?
Geronimo?
Tell you what.  Reminds me of life in the Delta.
Do you still ride?
You think I'm crazy.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald.  Another lunatic acting alone,
Nothing is easy.
You're certifiable.
Equitation.
Pretty scary, huh?
Has this happened to you before?
So what's the question?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
They're big details, Jerry.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot?  Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool.  Call the coroner in Rhode Island!  Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
They'll trace it.
Blue moon...
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day.  She --
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
<u>Why you</u>?
The truth shall make you free.
A vulgar pop term, but yes.  Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  That was our goal.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
And what did I say?
<u>My dog</u>.  One I intend to put to sleep.  Extrapolate from there.
Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
Where'd you get it?
You do recognize it then?
Yes.
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Where do you think Jerry is?
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
There's no plug to pull.
-- Or 'you're our kind of people --'
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
Ellie, I should have done this a long time ago, certainly before I left the N.S.F., but I wanted to give you every benefit of the doubt --
It's not like you've given me much choice.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
With me.
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
And?
How can that be?
J39 Z186...?
And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Could we hear to China?
No.  Please.
The powers that be have been quite busy lately, falling over each other to position themselves for the game of the century, if not the millennium.  Perhaps you've noticed.  Perhaps I could help deal you back in.
That would seem to be the question of the hour.  I want to build it, Doctor.  Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
Yes.  A shame.  Still... it'd be worse if they died for nothing.
As each component was tested and shipped off to Texas a duplicate was maintained and assembled in Hokkaido -- for backup purposes, of course. We've been right behind you the entire time.  You see my problem:  I couldn't appear to control too large a percentage; my enemies wouldn't stand for it.  So I simply made sure the Japanese consortium received the systems integration contract.  Of course no one had to know the corporations involved were recently acquired, wholly-owned subsidiaries --
I'd say this is slightly different.
Ellie.  Arroway.
'Any sufficiently advanced technology...'
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
The V.L.A.?
That you, Valerian?
I'm -- I'm fine.
It's all right, the important thing is you're safe --
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
I had... an experience.  Of belonging.  Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
I never knew my mother.  My father died when I was nine.
Did you love him?
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
What'd you think?
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
What...?
I'm sorry.
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Hi.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
You kill me, you really do.  The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
Oh my God...
Git movin', I said.
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
You never thought that's a heavy load?
What's all this dirt in the yard?
Please! Please!
Go git it, Luke.
Well, we ain't never had one of them. Where'd you think that was gonna get you?
That's right, Captain. Just passin' the time.
Had it done in Singapore. Bunch of us drunk as coots --
Borrowin' or payin' back?
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'!
Whatcha got?
He ain't eating beans fer lunch.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
A cold drink? You mean one cold drink? To feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on The Picture? A true vision of Paradise itself? With two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
They don't know iff'n to smile, spit or swallow.
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
We got it locked in the sock.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
One rule! No throwing up. He throws up, you forfeit everything.
Cuter again.
Back a buck.
You think you've been working hard. This muther'll break your back.
Stop that.
I got it myself... I couldn't wait.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
Investigators Halloran and Goetz.  I apologize for Goetz, he's a firehouse dog.
What first two murders.  We don't know about them here, do we?
He told me he had done two others just like it.
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
Tell me what you want me to say. Anything.
Wait... wait... I already called him, I threw it away.
Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
Hello, Daryll Lee.
Something personal.  Is he bothering you?
Where did you send the message to Peter Kurten?
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
What was that?  What am I hearing? The sound of an epiphany, a sudden blinding insight?
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
I have no life anymore.  I ruined your life, make me pay for it.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Oh, please.  I know what's coming, now.  "Let me help you..."
I want to tell you it's a great honor to meet you and talk to you.
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Well, it's a hell of an apartment you got here.  I'm living one step away from the projects, myself, but I get to go to work every day, wading in blood and guts.  I guess the books you wrote about these sons of bitches paid off pretty good.
How did you know they were stockings?
How do you know that?
I put my ass on the line, giving you that.
He felt sorry for me.  It was so nice to flirt.  He was a darling man.
You were the one that talked about moonbikes and called me a crank? Oh God, I <u>am</u>!  Make them some coffee.  Halloran, is it?  Investigator Goetz?  I had a crank call myself-- he said...  I thought it might be Daryll Lee Cullum.  I thought he might be out of prison.
I don't want this.  What are they?
The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
The problem for me is... you're in the witness category.  Know what I mean?
You know how to use this?
What's wrong with him?
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
You damn well better start working on that impulse control.  A woman who is implicated in this case? Someone who's practically a piece of <u>evidence</u>?
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
You didn't say serial killer and I didn't say serial killer.
There was no sperm.
Helen Hudson...
Just, I need results.  And -- I am short-handed.  Who else am I gonna give him?
The prowler in Hudson's apartment turns out to have a meeting with a suspect...
... third Bay Area woman has been strangled, but the police continue to deny that this is the work of one killer.  Lt. Thomas Quinn declares that the murders will be treated as unrelated crimes, unless new evidence...
We were together six years, sir!
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
Do you find him attractive?
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
I thought that was you, up there.
I don't think we should have come here. I'm surprised the police don't make it more difficult.
I take it you're not wearing white to reassure them.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Who is that? The announcer. Do I know him?
Please finish your story.
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
What does he want from you?
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
No, really. Tell me about the promotion.
Maybe.
What about the engagement party?
What do you think?
Oh no.
Paul could pop the question at any time.
Oh, Letty, what happened?
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
I'll see you soon.
Tomorrow?
Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
Yeah?
You took bets on my diagnosis?
He asked me to marry him.
It was romantic.   He's very romantic.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
I'm starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
Tell me all.
So there were no problems?
Where to?
Hey.
It doesn't matter.    It'll work out.
Bye, Uncle Cort.  What's with the lie?
I saw you talking to my Mom.
Why'd you tell?
I love you so much.
Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I guess I should go now.
I'm going to the store.
Are you all right?
That's a big question.
I think we need to talk about some things.
Well, I understand.     I know my behavior was poor.
So, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, I don't think I can put you back in the classroom just yet.
It's a very nice letter. But I have to go with what's best for the students.
They left about a half hour ago.
Jesus.   What kind of FBI agent are you?
Oui.
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
-- Super what?
Okay.   How much?
He missed three weeks.
I did. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" did the deed.
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?
You rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
I only have your word for that.
Thank you.
Because you're the closest.
He said to go fuck yourself.
You didn't buy batteries?
I'm not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you're testing mine.
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
It makes sense. I mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
What?
You haven't answered my question.
Does it really matter what I say?
I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
-- Did you set it up?
What?
Okay, we're square now, right?
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
Well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
What hotel?
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I see.   A master criminal.
This kind.
I'm the driver.
A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.
How about Canada?
C'mon, I look more like Elvis than you do.
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
No.
Anybody know about that car outside?
Yeah, I dig him.
How are we going to do that?
Glenmorangie.
So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
You got it in a bar?
Can't sleep?
No.
What are you doing?
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?
Yeah. I'm going home today.    What do you want, Frankie?
Who are you?
I don't care about your sword.
Where's your master?
Why are you still here?  You killed a policeman.  You should leave! You'll bring ruin on my whole family.
Shut up!
You don't seem to understand.
Are you related to Li Mu Bai?
I heard you met Shu Lien today.
But I have had much practice.  As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us.  They'd let me play with their weapons.  The scabbard is so beautiful.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
Am I?  I wish I were like the heroes in the books I read.  Like you and Li Mu Bai.  I guess I'm happy to be marrying.  But to be free to live my own life, to choose whom I love... That is true happiness.
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Not true.  I can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
I don't take orders from anyone.
Good.  And how are you?
I don't understand.  How can you part with it?  It has always been with you.
No, not yet...
But your men are watching over Yu's compund?
I admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I'd missed it.
You think Jade Fox will show up?
Giang Hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... I tried sincerely to give it up but I have brought us only trouble.
What happened?
Li Mu Bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he's trying to tell you something?
Has Governor Yu ever seen the sword?
What do you have in mind?
Sure it coulda.  Funboy's not here, neither is T-Bird -- none of Top Dollar's number ones.
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Care for a hot dog?
No onions though, okay?
No onions?
Are you nuts, walking into a gun?
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night.
I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass...
How 'bout the morgue?
I went to see a friend of mine.
Mom tried to cook.
I'm looking for a good guitar man.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
Cute nickname, don't you think?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- !
You need to learn to mind your own business or you'll never get where you think you're going.
Shut up.
Don't waste my time.
I know of no one.  But even if there is, I am sure it is nothing outside your capacity to deal with?
Do you think this childish machismo impresses me?  When I was a boy in Saigon I watched my country change one block at a time,  one building at a time.  Whole lives erased.  A way of life, polluted.  Today, no one forces me to move.  I use my powers to change your country, one block at a time,  one building at a time.
Excuse me?
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
You talking to me?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
You're naked.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Who?
Doing what?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
What are you doing?
Of Human Bondage.
Somerset Maugham.
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Why are you doing this?
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Good for you.
Hi.
You don't know how to love.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Do you want to learn or not?
Why?
That's one way of looking at it.
Excellent.
You think he'll like it?
No.
No. This is going to be our last session.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Hi, mom.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Yes!
Hello.
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
Sounds intriguing.
Why not?
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
You would not believe what--
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
Have you succeeded in your task?
You amaze me.
So what went wrong?
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Ronald? That's crazy.
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Who the hell do you think you are?!
Hi. Is Annette at home?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
It's really important.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
What are you talking about?
But you don't keep a cat, do you?
I love the smell of pine.
Yes, darling.
Are they nice?
Well  the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
Where is everybody?
It's your play.
No, darling, I hadn't intended to.
Yes, I did.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?
They ran away.
It's true.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories  I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
For as long as you'll let me.
But you must!
The numbers simply don't mean anything
Your children?
Yes, winter's coming.  I don't like the winter,
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
About time for you to come home, Amy.
Little miss, don't you never come here alone. You gave me a fright, you did.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
But what happened to the little deer?
Because it can't. It's dead.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me  always!
Hide me? Why?
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Let the child stay.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.
That's because she made a promise, and she'a keeping it, aren't you, darling.  You saw the way she played this afternoon, Edward.
Well, that seems a harmless fancy --
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
There was a sale.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
No, I'm not a lesbian. Geez mom.
Maybe they have to pee.
Are you kidding? He might as well say, "Can I date rape you?"
There you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
No. I don't think so.
I don't remember. We kissed at my door and next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.
I guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
I thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
Give him the tampon test.
Frida, this is a bad time. We're having sex and George actually answered the phone.
So where's this infamous arm now?
Why not? There's been a murder.
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
I could smell another woman on him.
No.
Peter knows something.
Does that mean this whole thing is over?
The thing is, I really like him. I finally meet a guy I really like and I'm a fuckin' werewolf.
Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you love him he'll be fine.
I guess you'll find out.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
You don't have to pee.
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
It's a matter of life and death.
Mark.
On your desk.
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
Uh.... hi!
I thought we were starting something... and then... I know it's unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case and all.
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
If you don't like me, just say so. You don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
That I'm a doormat of course. The shrink makes more notes.
I think I'm a werewolf.
We can get a warrant if you like.
You heard about Carlton Fraser?
You have some weird friends. What does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
How the hell is that your business?
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
You kiddin'? They try to get ME drunk.
She's got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired someone to kill them.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
He means the last that we know of.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
So... they're on some cycle. The murders... Gregory... then 28 days later... Carlton.
Doctor!  What brings you here?
Why are you wearing that thing on your face?
Iím your new assistant.
Why, yes.
Why are they after you?
They've taken my mind, my memories...
What?  Who has?
You see it?
Ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  Is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  Not even a detail?   You must try.
Known me for long?
You've been working too hard.
Why?
What happened to you?
Don't say a .
Is this dangerous or anything?
First Lady...
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
You mean the press conference?  I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
Die, you pond scum!
... What?
We think so.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
What about her.
Check his kids.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
You're kidding.
No!...  WE didn't anything...
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free.  I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
I'll lock him away for good.
Uh-oh...
It's fine.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
That'd be great.
In the car.
The teleprompter.  Is it hooked up?
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.
Perceptual?
Call Bob and Reed.  Tell them I need them immediately.
Well...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
I care about the homeless.
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
... . Ellen.
Where are you going?
What?
You have a lot of secrets.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
They're crucifying you out there.
I missed...
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Then why did you come here?
What do we do? Let'em know we're here....or what?
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
It's a disease. It's a...a bug...a parasite that infects the brain.
Datura Metel. The Devil's Trumpet. Don't worry. I ain't goin' religioso again. It's a flower that grows on these islands. Where I come from the voodoo priests used it whenever they needed a Mickey Finn. It's toxic. Ground up you can put it in a drink or inject it...or...in a sealed area it might be introduced through the ventilation system.
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
What?
I say we got a boat. Can you get other stuff?
What?
What you wanna do?
Prayers have no power to save. The knife can save. It can cut the disease away. The bullet. It can shatter the brain where the evil takes seed. These are saviours...our new saviours...our only saviours.
We must wait. One day the curse will pass. One day a dead man will... will...
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Julie Grant is a behaviouralist. She's not medical. She hasn't been as...exposed to...to things...as some of the rest of us. She'll be alright. I'll talk to her. She'll be alright.
Some of Rhodes' men. At the door.
Oh, bullshit, Mary. It's because Rhodes is a prick.
We're both gonna leave. Leave the island. I've been talkin' to Tricks. We think we can smuggle out one of those inflatable rafts. They're crated up real small. They've got air canisters. There's food inside. Even a little motor.
Just....following procedure, sir. They're entitled to burial.
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
Charlie Dalton.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Knox, you gotta calm down.
Oh come on, Cameron, don't you get anything?
Why? Nobody knows who we are.
Sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, Charles.  You still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
Yes sir.  We were just talking about that.
Who's in?
What good will that do?
Ginny Danburry's here.  Look for her.
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
Chris!
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
John, the curriculum here is set.  It's proven.  It works.  If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
A madman.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  Kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.
Neil, I know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  You have to let him see who you are-  It's your only chance.
I know what he'll say.  He'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that I should forget about it.  He'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Why don't you read it to her? It worked for Nuwanda.
Are you crazy? What's wrong with that?
Any group pictures in the annual?
His grades are hurting, Charlie.
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
But father, it's not fair.
Nobody-  I thought I'd surprise you. I've got all As and-
My brother went here.
What?
Found what?
A play, dummy.
And now he will?
First I gotta get the part, then I'll worry about that.
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Oh..
This play?
Visit from my father.
Who are you?
And what? These things are octopusses?
No, it just struck me as odd...I don't see you for all these years and you've still got the same tape stuck in the box.
Which question is that?
The one you came up to ask...are we on schedule?
Don't mind him Finnegan...you remember 25...balls of steel... splashing around in a sea of testosterone.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
Speedboat in the middle of the ocean...
How soon can we get up and running?
We were talking about my schedule...
The thieves.
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
That's what I do.
Anti social?
Hey! I didn't have to come back.
What?
I don't mean to drop in unannounced ...you ready...
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Can somebody tell me what the object of the exercise is here?
I think we gotta stop floating from one fucked up situation to the next...
Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
What was that?
What is it man?
Fucking women, man...
Those are mine!
I'll get the boots.
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
I do!!!
Fucking A.
Yeah.
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
I love Linda, see. I love Linda more than I can even say.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Oh. Fine.
Take last night...! Last night he coulda had twenty fuckin' deer! More! He coulda had more! And look what he does! I mean look what he fuckin' does!!!
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?
Why?... What do you mean?... Why???
Hi.  Nick, your shoes are soaking.
Sure. Are you kidding? Sure.
Okay.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!
Frost.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Does this... I mean, how does this job work out?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
Ah yes. Of course... So few survive.  La creme de la creme... How did you obtain release?
Playing.
Who the hell is he?
You have to think about this, Sal. Listen to me, Sal! You have to think about this.
Where are we going, Merle? Are we going home?
I just wait. You know?
I just wait. For this... It's what I wait for... I wait all year.
Yeah... I guess.
What do you mean?
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
Yeah.
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
No.
Just like always! Just like it always was! Right, Nick? Am I right?
The fuck I did!!!
Down I would say... What would you say?
That's him.  Simon Doucet.
Michael called yesterday.  He wants to take Willy for the summer.
Who is it?
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
Doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I'm rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  What's your status?
Need help?
You my partner?
But Sergeant...
Got it.  Ejection seat?
I'll be okay.
No.  Talk English.  Then I'll understand.
You want to be a good detective?
Part of Doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  This area rates response to outside stimuli.  Com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  It could be why he kills.
Great.  My partner's Marcus Welby.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What is it?  Your legs?  Hands?
What's it mean?
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
It's mine, Ma! Pa made it for me -- and I'm not going to give it to anyone!
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Howdy, Mr. Stone. We've come round to ask you if you made up your mind to join the Grange?
No, Stone!
Real! Sheriff, you are a witness that this money is paid me voluntarily, and while it does not satisfy the mortgage, it has become my property.
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
It's mine?
No, no! Give it to me!
Well, I'll be -- 
What a headstrong fellow! Well -- I guess you're quite prepared to suffer the consequences.
Ten throws -- Mr. Webster?
I don't seem to be so very popular after all -- in Cross Corners.
Contracts? -- Yes, they have contracts with me -- lots of 'em -- but -- but that's all right. Without me and my money, they wouldn't have anything.
Not long -- now.
Ma says breakfast's ready, Mr. Webster!
Worst I had in years -- ahem -- starting a spring cold, I guess -- er -- don't happen to have a bit of camomile tea in the house, do you, Stone?
And so, Jabez Stone, in the name of the Whig Party of Cross Corners, we offer you the nomination of that party for Selectman.
But -- I was just lucky.
You are not so sure that he'll come.
Not all of it?
Mary, I'm a farmer -- always will be. To me seed isn't a thing to pay debts with, it's alive, more alive than anything -- but I guess you're right. We just got to do it. Oh -- how's it all going to end?
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
Mary -- what would you do?
What do you think of that, Jabez?
We must go on home, Jabez.
I'm serious.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
It shows on your face.
Jabez!
There! Guess that ought to hold good. Put him down here, by the fire, Mary.  But we don't want to get him too close -- we'll have roast pork for supper.
What's ailing that dog?
My son! Do you really think, Ma....
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Let him try it.
Jabez -- seems  like I've been hearing talk around. Reverend Harper thinks more Cross Corners folk oughter be in church, Sabbath morning.
Well Mary, it's too bad I didn't know -- I would have given you a real dinner, but with my wife being in Washington -- Have another piece of pie -- 
You don't have to defend him to me, Mary -- I've been called names myself.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
Why, certainly -- but be careful, Mr. Scratch -- Medford rum has an uncanny habit of kicking back, even with old-timers like yourself. 
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
You can talk to me ...
What's happening?
I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband.  Hi there.
John, they're giving me a few minutes to try and talk some sense into you. I know you think you're doing your job, and I can appreciate that, but you're just dragging this thing out. None of us gets out of here until these people can negotiate with the LA police, and they're just not gonna start doing that until you stop messing up the works.
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
Hans, he killed by brother --
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
My job and my title and my salary did nothing to our marriage except change your idea of what it should be.
Oh, here it comes.  One of those 'meaningful relationship conversations.' I never should've let you get those magazine subscriptions --
Excuse me, I'm looking for --
Yeah.  How'd you know?
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Roy?  You still with us?
I got it.  But you can tell her yourself.  Just watch your ass and you'll make it.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
What's it look like?  We're going in.
No.  I never smile any more.
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.
Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV!
Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
Yeah.  It was terrible.
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
That's it.
Would you do something for me? Please?
How did they think that?  What are they... crazy?  What do you mean. That's bullshit, Leon.  They're giving you a fucken story.
They won't talk to you.
Are they on the phone still?
What are you doin' in there?
Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?
Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
You frisk me.
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
Okay, give us the women.
The girl hostages.
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
Aspirins ... okay you got it.  Charlie!  Six pizzas!
What makes you think you'll be able to control it?
It's all we got.
Hello, Mulvaney here...
Now, you -- what's your name?
I got two kids ... and I'd like to see them again.
What?
Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do?
You like me?
Yeah.
Hey, girls -- I was on television...
No, not until after they killed him.
I used to, but I stopped.
My body?  What for?
Goddamn women...
It's the cops.  Shit!
... The bodies out the door.
I want him to think that.
We'd kill ourselves.
What?
What's wrong?
What are you trying to pull?
I forgot she's in here.
What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim.  'Rob a bank!  What not?'
Here's your document, Sonny.
Fuck!  We did it!
Mom - they're sending a bus to take us to the airport.  You understand? If you're here - they're not gonna send it.  They'll think I'm gonna come out with you.
For God's sake don't start in on Heidi again ...
Did I say a thing against her?  God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
Not now, Mom, please.
Oh.  Run.
But I mean, why do you need to steal?  Couldn't you get a job?
You could give up.
<i>They can do subtitles.</i>
Who the hell is that?
What is it, Choco?
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
<i>Mr. Cigliuti?</i>
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
I've already formulated a plan.
Hello?
Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
<i>That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
<i>After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash.</i> <b> INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING </b> Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
How did you meet Choco?
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
What did he say about the arm?
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
<i>Gotta strip/ Gotta give some lip/ Gotta make my tip/ But keep yo hands to yourself - Cuz you ain't touching these tits.</i>
I don't like anything else.
Yes?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
Did you ask Sal?
How much?
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
No, you the man.
You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. Where did you read that?
It's been about a year.
Good morning.
Gotta go.
I'm coming.
I'll see you out.
He's completely innocent.
You are too crude.
Jade, you're late.
Twenty "D" Duracells.
C Duracell.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
Mookie, get offa da phone.
C'mon, Sal.
Whatdafuck do you want?
Sal, I want my money.
We both do.
How much?  How much do I owe you?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Hot.  Hot.
Tina, you are too slick.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
It's cold.
Later for you.
Tina, I'll be right back.
Later.
Who's your favorite basketball player?
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
Yeah.
Whaddup.  Money?
I know this.
I'm listening.
Good.  I want you to listen.
Mookie's OK.
I like Mookie a lot.
Sal's Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  He's making us lose business.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead...and alive.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Pop, what else can I say?  I don't wanna be here, they don't want us here.  We should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in Bensonhurst.
You're gonna be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Four colors? Neato!
Yeah. Look at this polar bear. It hasn't moved in half an hour. And those Eskimos over there...I'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Excuse me?
I checked with the school board, she's not an accredited teacher.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
HARRY? Are you okay?
Are you kidding? I'll be down in a "I-crapped-my-pants."
What are you wearing?
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Then a sleep-over is okay by me. Okay boys, eat up.
You could've saved that for the tooth fairy!
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Home school. Til today.
I think it's just over there.
No, it's a treasure map.
My mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
You know Harry, this is my favorite time of day.
The principal.
No, I just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. Saves time. Out with the old, in with the new.
Can we eat there tomorrow?
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
LLOYD, she's my mom.
Where did you learn that word?
Welcome to public school, my friend.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
Nice jugs.
...cause you said...
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
Well... Uh...maybe... jeez, how can I say this... you and I could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
That's a cow, Harry.
Shut up!
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?
Don't snap at me like that. You're lucky I don't punch you right in the face.
Me, me, me!
No. What happened?
George Washington!
You're it.
It's okay. I want the rush.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
I made the polar bear pants.
But I ate your Mom's pie.
Something about showing the world what Principal Collins has done.
A float!
HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
Damn! What are the odds?
She's one of a kind.
Try one in a million!
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
MS. HELLER, mind if I tag along on your field trip? I'm thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
Last year Toby was in A.P. English. And Lewis won the Science Fair. What are they doing in Special Needs?
Well, what have we here? It appears be a tape.
If dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
Why ith dat newth?
So could you get us into the principal's office?
That's it. I'm done.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Ha! I said "doll-hairs." Psych! But a deal's a deal, my friend. In you go.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
Your assignment is to pick the class. Find some other students just as special as you.
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
... and, Principal Collins, you'll be pleased to know that this year Wednesdays are "South of the Border" days. We'll serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
And...?
What?
JESSICA. Are you sure?
Are you going to kill her?
I sold all the wind instruments.  Hawaiian Air, business class. And you like that new fur coat?
We felt his presence.
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
We have just folded space from Ix...
Yes?... How was your journey?
Basically...
Shield practice? Gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... I'm not in the mood.
Things have been so serious here lately.
Gurney... I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.  Let him stand free.
Stop!  Get back!!  She has the weirding way.  Why didn't you tell us!  Great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  As a leader of my people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  Your water shall mingle with our water.
I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
Are you a Fremen?
We call that one Muad'dib.
The Water of Life.
I hold at your neck the gom jabbar. Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. A Duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Not all of them... I know which ones will.
You mustn't speak of...
I know.  But if it is a trap then why are we going?
No.  I don't work here.
Thank you.
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
But you're a big star!
They were <u>mythic</u>.  They had a poetry to them.  And you know what else?  The women prefer the traditional monsters.
Hey Bela, how do you do that?
Bela! It's so great to see you!  And eight o'clock on the dot.  Right on time!
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
Hmm... my biggest hit?  That would probably be "Dracula."
We can't.  Those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
No!  <u>Doctor Acula</u>!  You can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you're a doctor!  Not a count.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!
Eddie, I'm so tired... I don't know if I can handle a night shoot...
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Why are you here??
I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
Really?  I don't feel so great.
Eddie, how was I?
Last night was quite a romp.
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
Eddie, I want to thank you.  These last few days have been a good time.
So guess where I'm going next weekend?
And once I'm a woman, Jean-Claude and I are getting married --
PLACES, EVERYONE!  ROLL CAMERA!
Rolling.
Ah.  The director of "Glen Or Glenda."
Cris, you made it.  Thanks a lot.
Excuse me.  Doctor?  I'm with Mr. Lugosi.  How is he?
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Orson Welles was 26 when he made "Citizen Kane."  I'm already 30!
<u>That's not the issue</u>!!  Ugh!  How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
All I wanna do is tell stories.  The things I find interesting...
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
None.  But his dad gave me fifty grand.
Pleased to meet you.  I'm Loretta King.
For this one, we need $60,000.
Well then you should pay him, shouldn't you?
Well, Mr. Feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I've got my own movie.
Well... I've got another project I wasn't gonna tell you about. Lugosi's in it, but he's got a smaller part.  The lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named Dolores Fuller.  The title is "Bride Of The Atom."
Mr. Wood?!
It's a guaranteed blockbuster!
"Perfect"?  Mr. Wood, do you know <u>anything</u> about the art of film production?!
People won't notice.  Filmmaking isn't about picky details -- it's about the big picture.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Can I help you?
Nah, I'm all man.  I even fought in WW2.  'Course, I <u>was</u> wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
Hello.
What are you making?
Oh, flowers!  I didn't know you were so traditional.
I had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  But I never missed a Lugosi picture after that.
What was that?
No.  They're beyond that!  They're smarter than the humans.  What's <u>more</u> advanced?
Please!  It'll only take a minute. You can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  There's a really nice dentist from Oxnard...
It's terrible.  People won't even return my calls.  It's like I don't exist.
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
I don't know.
Yeah...?
You're sure this is gonna work?
...Do you accept the Lord Jesus Christ as your savior?
This is our choir director.  He's gonna play the young hero.
Are you IN5ANE?  <u>I'm</u> the director! <u>I</u> make the casting decisions around here!
Mr. Wood?  <u>What do you think you're</u> <u>doing</u>?!
What are you, an angora wholesaler?
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
How's your mother?
Al!
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
What?
Ooh, the sister! She is hot.
I bet my career on you. You'd better be good.
They tore her dress! ...
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
I was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "If you're over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." And I'm laughing and then I realize I wear a nametag.
Oh, that thing. Yeah. Did you hear about this?
Yeah, a thing. He became a big hero. He was on TV and there was a parade and a movie about him
Are the TV people with you?
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
Mm.
I mean, that worked out.
All right -- do you want to know the truth? I took you and Marcia and Ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. So I took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. Okay?
Oh God. What hospital?
Why? How...
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Hey, Lou.
I told you. If we... you know do it, they go away until ... we're done.
I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because... they went away.
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Twenty-nine.
Where?
The what?
Kinda'.
Where were you?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
What is?!
You're in show business?
I'm making a tape.
Look -- there's a million ways to humiliate yourself - I gotta think of a new way? I mean, it's all day! Every minute. Id be like a monkey at the zoo. I just...
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
I don't know.
Polish acrobat.
Hi.
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
I was in jail.
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
I'm Jill. I really like your show. I think you're great.
Good?
Ed?
We don't have foibles.
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
Thank you.

Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
I guess you know why you're here
So what brings you here?
Huh.  Right.  College.  Wow.  Where are you going?  Where 'd you get into?
Where to?
Yes?
Why are you doing this?
What's this?
I hope so
Exactly when?
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
After Dave got fired, Sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
Yep.
We made a mistake.  Let's not make it worse.
Paul, what's your favorite fruit?
People can see this.
But other people can see them too.
She's doing this to get back at me
Well, I mean, you know, I talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there's all different kinds of fruit and...  It's nothing against you, Tracy. You're the best.  I just thought --
Hell, good luck!
Hey, Tammy, guess what happened today.
Merry Christmas.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
Yeah.
It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken...  Where'd this come from?
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
We talked.
Does that paper say we've been indicted?  Does it say Exley's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off?
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. 
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
What was that boyfriend's name?
We were never properly introduced. Susan and I were fighting that day.  She called him by a nickname.  Muns or Lunts or something.
Dudley.
He had help getting up there.  Two of his fingers are broken.
She's fine.
I am.  Are you soliciting for police charities?  The last time, you people called at my office.
I'm a homicide detective.  Where were you last night?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
What do you want to know?
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him.
Say what and so what.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
I heard you like to shoot dogs.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
That was his favorite toast.  I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three.
Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
Transfer me, suspend me.  Just leave me alone.
The Nite Owl was solved, Lieutenant.
She is Lana Turner.
The Nite Owl.  Anything bothering you about the case?
Why's she seeing Bud White?
Really?  What did White say?
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
Some reality.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
A police captain.  I think he's behind all of this.
When?
Do you think I ever could've been in the running?
None.  Call it a hunch.
My daughter was a virgin!
It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy?
The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm.
What's wrong, Trash?
Please hold the line... No such number is assigned.
Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Brill?
I don't know anything about Zavitz.
And you were the last one to talk to him.
I don't know what that means.
Yes.
Wait.
I don't know what that--
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
I mean did you call anyone.
You told me no calls.
Drive.
What about newspapers and magazines?
Same thing?
No.
What are you dialing?
He came in four minutes ago.
The thing is...it really can't wait.
--Don't think it could've gone any better. Tell me, how's Deb? How're my grandchildren?
Most of this stuff's only available to law enforcement.
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
Hi, Mr. Dean.
Pardon?
Someone said you spoke to Mr. Zavitz before he died. I thought you might know something.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Not that I could see.
Right.
Who did you work with to get the--
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
Stacy, I found out like this. This is the first I'm <u>hearing</u> of--
I think you should leave now, Robert.
Is Eric in school?
Well...yeah.
That's okay.
What is it?
Is this a fuckin' joke?
That ain't me.
This is fucked. You don't know <u>who's</u> in that--
How's the trout?
I mean it tastes like every other fish I've ever had. Every fish tastes the same.
Brill.
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.
Why would I--
He doesn't work that way.
I just want to make sure I'm not breaking the law.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
I'm an investigator with Pro-Tech Security.
We believe he did.
My shoe?
Listen--
Bobby--
Robert--
Yeah.
How long can you stay?
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
Your Bellmoth case. The FBI thinks there might be mob ties.
I don't know. I mean--
I have a family.
Turn yourself in.
He got hit by a bus.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
Who?
We'd have to--
It was in his bag. Now it's not.
Well...his real name's Edward Lyle.
Lyle?!
So they know everything.
Three minutes. We're going in light. Myself and two others. Everyone else is held back in reserve.
The fuck do you have goin' on with Sam Albert?
Hello!  Good morning.
You felt obliged to.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
I'd like you to have them.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
What?  No!
What?
No.
We've got to get you out of here.
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Do you have your papers, sir?
If I could just see some identification.
I looked at them.  They're shrubs, small trees.  Exquisite.  And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
Shut-up!
Is this you?
We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
No.
Where've you been?
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
I think that's called looting.
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
Thought you'd never wake up!
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you.  You killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Apprentices.
Of course.  Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
He's Canadian.
This is Captain McGann.
Could I ask you to move?  I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
We should charge!  Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
I'm not sewing anything else.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
Hello miss.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
Whoa - give me a chance!
I was looking forward to this evening.
I had a hotel room.
Yessir.
How awful.  What will you do?
How romantic.  With Fiona I fell over every five minutes.  Ronnie Christened me Lady Downfall.
Kip?
No.
You tell me.  I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
The windows don't open.
Why didn't I think of that?
You don't call, you don't write.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
Too late now.
We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
You can't.
Maybe I should drive this time.
Nice spot.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
So you had to be your own lifeline.
Camera in the--
Bookshelf. Sensors--
It's a party.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
You've got everything planned.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
That was a lifetime ago.
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
Relax, don't jam it...
Jesus.
I cannot get rid of you.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
You'll just have to have faith.
Um, Erin?  Listen.  Even though you're not necessarily my favorite person in the world ...  ... sometimes you're not half-bad.
In terms of land value out in Hinkley, Mr. Masry, we feel it's a more than fair price.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
An ER doctor who spends his days saving lives was the one out of control --
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
She must be a tough cookie, cause it's a pretty advanced case.  I'd say she's been walking around with it for a few weeks now.
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
It's a good day.  I feel good.
I can put them in a good school.
Any school you want.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
I'm sorry about that.  Really.  But --
You do know how to do that, don't you?
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
What are you doing here?
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
-- It's about being realistic.  Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation.  They'd completely bury us in paperwork.  I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
I like this case.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
Someone's following me.
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
She insulted me!
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --
Don't give me that.  You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
And if you had to guess ...
How do you know that?
You see your office?
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
Here what comes?
Two million dollars?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Every county has one.  They keep records of anything water-related within their jurisdiction.  You should be able to find something there.
It happens all the time.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
You've been reading for hours.
How come her own mom isn't helping her?
You got more than one?
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
What're you doing?
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
That is not what I'm --
What's that?
I can't leave my job, George.
And I miss you.
I'm embarrassed.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
It'll be fine, yeah.
Wow, that's soon --
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
I gotta say, Erin -- first time I saw you, I did not peg you as the kind to go off and conduct her own epidemiological study.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Much anger in him, like in his father.
He can do it.
Will he finish what he begins?
I can't ...
... Luke, you must not go.
I can help them!
Luke, I will not lose you to the Emperor, as I lost Vader.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Barks at his master.
I'm looking for someone.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Oh, your father ... a powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi.
Yes sir!
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
Thank you, General.  But there's a price on my head.  If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt, I'm a walking dead man.
Mistress Leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, Artoo, could fix it, if you like.
Sit down, and shut up!
We?
Me?  I don't know what you mean.
Probably an asteroid field ....
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.
There, there.  Chewie get a reading on that.  Looks pretty good.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.
Well, sometimes ... Ah-hah, I knew it!  Lando Calrissian.
Never heard of that system.
No thanks.
I've finished my circle and I haven't picked up any life read- ings.
I always said you were a gentleman.
Sorry friend, I had no choice. They arrived right before you did.
Shut up a minute and listen.  I'm doing what I can to make this easier for you.
We only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  If you put him in there, it'll kill him.
It's a lovely outpost.
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.
Have they analyzed the one that was killed?
Two transports at a time is awfully risky.
A tremor!
Leia!
Lando, is he alright? ... Lando? Are you there?  How's Luke?
Why not me?
Lord Vader ... Is the dark side stronger?
Yes, yes.  To Obi-wan you listen young one.  The tree.  Remember your failure at the tree!  Heh?
The Hoth System?
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
Humans?
Cuervo...?
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
It's so good to see you again.
He's... near.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
She's in the green.
Location.
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
How do we get out of here?
What the hell is this?
Hey, what's going down, Snake?
Yeah? Greenbacks? I got ten million of them.
I am Sir Lancelot of the Lake, from across the sea. I am the best knight in the whole of Christiandom, and I look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.
Yield. I have the advantage.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
Who is Merlin?
It's just that I have no experience, and no men to speak of. How can I--
How? Where?
Guenevere. And a beloved friend who will betray you.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
That is my destiny. I have a destiny, too...
I recognize you only as my son, no more.
He is the mightiest and fairest of knights.
Ye...
Sir Gahalt, answer the Queen.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
Who does it serve?
I have found you. The Queen. An apple. Tomorrow. Sir Gawain...
They do.
--I am the sea, which covers the desert forever under its weight.
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
Well why are they tearing the building down?
What honey?
Hi
Oh great, anything else?
Dinner at the White House.
What did the doctor say?
This was under Regan's pillow. Did you put it there?
No. Not at all,
Not that I know of.
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
No. No rats.
Bastard! I will kill you.
She is going to be well?
Karl if you put this in Regan's room I want you to tell me, now did you?
Fine thank you.
Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
Convulsion?
No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
Well it just doesn't happen anymore Mrs. MacNeil.
That's all the more reason to forget about exorcism.
I can't do it. I need evidence that the church would accept as signs of possession.
I don't know. I'll have to look it up.
No.
Did you know my mother died recently?
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Wanna drink.
She...killed Burke Dennings.
Yes. He's already here.
Yeah.
Cause I like it.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!
All done.
So what's next?
I believe you.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
She seemed fine.
Who's in it?
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
You'd like that?
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Quod nomen mihi est?
Who are you?
Uoy era ohw.
...and to redeem through your son. Who lives and reigns with you, in the unity of the holy spirit, God forever and ever.
Have we met?
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Really?
Let me tell you how Father, and please confidential. Burke Dennings, good Father, was found at the bottom of those steps leading to 'M' Street, with his head turned completely around. Facing backwards.
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
One last time: Can you think of some priest who fits the bill?
Who?
Stick your cock up her ass! You mother fucking, worthless cocksucker!
Are you comfortable Regan?
Is there someone inside you?
Sometimes.
I don't know.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
What's wrong with them?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
My brother and I. One each.
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.
Get your hand off me.
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
How we doing?
They don't.  They're always asking about you.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
You got weird kids, Frank.
Bosen black.  Flat.
No thanks.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.
Says who?
Your older brother.
What do you mean?
So talk to me tomorrow.  After the gig.
What're you talking about?
Jack.
What?
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains.  Look good as new.
The hell you don't.
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
What?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
Where the hell is she?
No.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Yeah.  Something.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
Day.  Wednesday.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know.  I'm,flexible.
Christ, can't you hear it?
What?
What the hell are you doing?
Two hours ago!
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
You saw wrong.
What're you doing down here?
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
The tenth's out.
Cancel, Frank.
I don't know.
You don't know?
What're you doing?
Yeah, fine.
Bought it on the way over.  Clean as a nun.
No, no.  You boys are tired.
Blanche.
No romance, right?  That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
You're an hour and a half late.
You're an hour and a half late.
Come on.
Hey!
I wear a seven.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night.  Chills. Through the whole audience.  I could hardly play.
Wow. You ever see her again?
Hey, will you look at that?
Uh ...
Good morning, gentlemen.  I'm Mr. Daniels, the manager.  I believe I've spoken to one of you on the phone.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Barker.  Jock Barker?
Baker.  Jack Baker.
Yeah.
He leads, I follow.
Fucking.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Hey.  You feel like a cup of coffee?
He do that every year?
Every year.
What'd I say?
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
So, what happened?
Frank said ---
Yeah.
Vegetables.
Losing his teeth.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop.  Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
Is that what you used to do?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Sure.
None?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
How did he expect to do that?
How is he?
Pollux is -- what?
That's your name, isn't it?
It was confirmed by your personal security code. Nobody knows that code but you!
I can't even look at you without wanting to vomit.
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
You've made us look pretty good in the past week.  And the way you handled the press --
As much as ever.  Nothing.
What is with you tonight?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
Great.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Oh, and Oxxford called...
Excuse me?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
And I know people.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Trouble at work?
You see, its like were in each others heads...
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She is relentless.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack.  Youre not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
It wouldnt really be cheating...  Its complicated.
You never really talked to me.  I wanted to talk to you, man...
Got a minute, Jack?
Cmon Jack...
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Look, I dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
How much time?!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
Are we finally being honest?
Thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
About the plane? What do you think its gonna crash? Dont say that...
You look forward to this party all year.  Whats with you today?
Shes your dog, Jack.
She got those shoes...
Whats the difference? Im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Okay...
Worse, you mean...
Cmon, Jack, you think there arent mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell Im doing in New Jersey...
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Good things...
Pretty incredible, isnt it?
This place is a perk, Kate.
A perk for what?
But Ive done some good things too, havent I?
Are you okay, Jack?
I'm sorry...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and Im going to be heading it up.
Jesus, Jack...
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, lets get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
Peter.  I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question.  An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
Damn...damn...damn...
Did you really mean what you said about Tuscany?
Merry Christmas...
What about his first born?
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
What the --!
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
Ben?
I'm worried about you.
He didn't.
Oh, he did.
At this rate, the infection should be complete in two, maybe three weeks --
What?
This is wrong in so many ways.
Johnny.  SUPERNOVA.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
But I'm not done with the machine --
It has to be the cloud.  It's fundamentally altered our DNA.
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
The power...I need...more power...to control...the storm --
Raising the shields.
Victor, I'm sorry I --
He's working round the clock.  But the data needs to be tested, analyzed before --
Where do we stand?
The less time, the better.
Another delay... With only forty-two minutes left.
Hello, Grant. Good to see you again.
Brain injury.
Duval. Dr. Peter Duval. Top brain man in the country. Ever hear of him?
Wish I knew why.
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
You mean <I'm> going along?
It's only for an hour --
Just one, General...
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.
What is it?  Anything wrong?
Yes, a fistula too small to show up on the X-rays.
He's making a fine recovery.
Shouldn't you answer that?
Open it! Open it before they get here!
That's what they pay me for.
Keeping an eye on Dr. Duval...
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
But that isn't possible.
If it won't work, it's beyond my power to fix it. But if it does, there's no telling how long it will hold up. It's a jury rig, at best, and we'll need every second of use we can get out of it. That's why I don't want to put any extra strain on the connections by running unnecessary tests.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
You left something out.
Removal Point? What're you talking about!
Dr. Duval, you are not going through with this! I absolutely forbid it! I'm responsible for the lives of everyone here! I will not allow you or anyone else to leave this ship!
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
We'll never get there in time, at this rate.
"Yet all the suns that light the Corridors of the Universe shine dim, Before the blazing of a Single Thought -- "
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
Tell them to take us out.
There it is!
Looks like the sea, at dawn.
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
I'm in charge of this mission! You were instructed to take orders from me, not give them!
I can't tell you.
I'm married.
All in all, quite a canoe...
Come on -- it's no use!
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
We're entering a Capillary. Remain in the middle.
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
What do you mean?
I got your goddamn money, you little punk. Now where's my daughter?
Where's my daughter?
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
What?
We stop at Pancakes Hause.
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Oh, for Chrissakes here -
IS IT, JERRY?  You ask those three pour souls up in Brainerd if a deal's a deal! Go ahead, ask 'em!
You're there in thirty minutes or I find you, Jerry, and I shoot you, and I shoot your fucking wife, and I shoot all your little fucking children, and I shoot 'em all in the back of their little fucking heads. Got it?
You called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! Ready to make delivery, ya says! Come on down and get it!  And here ya are and you're wastin' my time and you're wastin' my wife's time and I'm payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
What'd this guy look like anyways?
Uh-huh.
You know what a disparity is?
Yeah!
Yah!
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah, so we're all set.
Yah, okay, I'll have my girl send you over a copy, then.
No, no, fax is -
Things have changed. Circumstances, Jerry. Beyond the, uh... acts of God, force majeure..
My patience is at an end.
Shep said you'd be here at 7:30. What gives, man?
Twice.
Yah, pretty good.
Whatcha watchin' there?
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
Never heard of him. Don't vouch for him.
Call 'em up.
Hiya, Lou.
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Uh-huh.
Yah, that's a good one.
Yah.
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
Better times.
I was so... I been so... and then I saw you on TV, and I remembered, ya know... I always liked you...
...I'm sorry... I shouldn't a done this... I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've...
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Yah, is this Marge?
Linda.
No.
Yah.
Whose car?
Pretty good. Found out the Hautmans are entering a painting this year.
They're real good.
...So?
I love you, Margie.
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
The first rule of Project --
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Oh.
Bob, Bob... I'm a member.
Have you finished those reports?
You don't get paid to abuse the copy machine.
Okay.  Where to begin?  With your constant absenteeism?  With your unpresentable appearance?  You're up for review...
Just who the fuck do you think you are?!  Get out!  You're fired!
It means it was homemade.
I'd like to thank the academy...
Sure.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
These are my groups.  I was here first.  I've been coming for a year.
I... I don't know.  I guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...
You haven't been going to yours.
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
There?
Whatever.
When?
Do you care?
I don't know.
The Paper Street Soap Company.
We did make love?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
Why are you doing this?
I just called a second ago.  There was no answer.  I'm at a payphone.
Throwers don't worry about ticking. Modern bombs don't tick.
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
What do you want me to do?
Thank you.
Well, uh... great.
And, now it's gone.
What list?
Well, I have to file a claim...
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
-- Like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
No one really knows that they've seen it. But they did.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
But a good strange.
He was setting up franchises.  My father never went to college, so it was really important that I go.
I know that.
Hum.
A guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  After a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
Oh, and my pace is more librarians.
She needs an exorcist.  This isn't love.  This is sport-fucking.
What?
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
... Marla ... ?
No thanks, I quit.
You quit?
Yeah.  Where you headed?
What do you want?  A statement of purpose... ?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
What are you doing?!
What the hell ... ?!
I don't know!  Nothing!
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
Answer me, Tyler.
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.
What about them?  They're lunatics.
Night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Tyler...
Ask me nicely.
Defuse the bomb?
What?
I'm doing this for us.
Please understand... I've gotten all I can from this, Tyler.
Listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
There is no money.
S-S-Stuff.
I... I don't know...
Would you rather be dead?
You were there?
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
What did you see?  What am I looking for?
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
The only reason he was on Route 18 was because he own the lottery and had to collect the winnings.
You've made your point.
Maybe.  What's this about?
Tell me again how it started.
Shouldn't we pull over?
Want me to drive?
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
What on Earth are they doing?
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
"It?"
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
4:25.
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
I'll remove him.
You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it.
You're the fuckin' devil.
C'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over Greenland, or something?
Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl.
I know what you're doing!  It's alright to be scared, Carter. You don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. Not now.
Huh?
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Yeah.  It's not hard once you get the hang of it.  In the wrist. Anyway, I did what I always do when I get one...
What's that?
That's what I'm here for.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
Powerful warrior.
Roundeye.
That guy's not going to make it.
Can you handle the door gun?
I thought he was with you.
Where's Nguyen now?  What city?
Half their air force is our stuff. Captured.
Take your time.
So there never was a Phase Two rescue team?
Can you walk?
This your stuff?
Yeah.  Big time.
I just wanted... I don't know... after all that... I just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, John." And mean it.  That's all.  After all that.
What?
Meeting ... people.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
Can I have my desk please.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
What are you two up to?
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... There's coffee if you want...
Ugh, these tapes are a mess.  I don't know where to begin...
<u>Listen</u>!  We both got something out of it, all right!
What if I was a relative?
No...  He is supposed to live there?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
I wanna go...Just let me go...
Where?  Maybe we can.
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.
I... I was just leaving.
Huh-huh.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well there....  What's the difference?
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
Have I died?
Where am I?
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
Well what am I gonna do with it?
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
Are there any questions?
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
It's just a bum...You know, there's enough in here for the two of you.
You can't leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
You don't have to say that.
I never say anything I have to.
What are we about to do?
You're married.
No.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Yes.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I'm sorry.
What?
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Okay, Ray...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
No.
Sure you don't want anything?
I'm sorry, we don't have side orders of toast. I can give you an English muffin or a coffee roll.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I just can't look at you.
I have to talk seriously with you...
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
I'd rather drive up myself and... maybe go into Canada after... And I can't stay long, Tita, probably a week, at the most.
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Uhm hmm. Some range.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
You were going without saying goodbye?
Swimming?
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Thank you.
I don't think that's accurate...
Is he?
Robert?
I have to talk to you.
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
That's three games to none, Carl.
Oh, for chrissakes...
Oh, no. You're more than welcome.
What about it? Wouldn't you agree that a great deal of mischief has been done in the name of love?
Well...
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Wait a minute. I'm not that neat, maybe, but I am clean.
In my personal observation, I think that more people are neat than are clean...
What?
What chu listening to rumors for? I'm not like dat.
Whadja wanna see me about?
A play-ya.
I look good, that's it. So what else do you do for these girls?
I did.
Wussup?
Wussup, Victor.
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
For real?
How old is he?
How do I know you're not lying.
You wanna do somethin' with me?
Look. You know that and I know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. I think it's that bozo, Hanrahan, I can't be sure. Anyway, unless I go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
I don't know how he doesn't know. He doesn't know.
I ought to get some sleep.
Creasy, how old are you?
Fletch, this is dumb.
They didn't do anything.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
You can't keep me here.
Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her.
Yes.
Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
So what do you figure?
Like tonight.
Affirmative.
You're in the Records Room.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
Oh my God!
Oh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate. Have you got a paper bag, or something.
I guess not.
My lawyer was a bum.
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases.
Harry S. Truman?
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Okay.  Now, the last time you saw your son was when?
What the hell does this have to do with insurance?
Its okay. The cops did it.
They bust you every week.
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.
Sure you did.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
Maybe, Fletch. Is that Brazil?
Why not?
It is nothing of a sexual nature I assure you.  One thousand, just to listen. I don't see how you could turn that down Mr...
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
You don't look sick, Mr. Stanwyk.
Not with the scum you hang out with. I've watched. I've thought. Its a perfect scheme. I even have a perfect escape plan for you.
I'm still here.
LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
Will you kill me?
Kareem's in the wash. I need a favor.
Yeah.
I'm sorry?
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
Alan's in Utah.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
What is this?
A four hundred dollar lunch tab!
Act natural.
What is this....
Bastard.
Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill.
Hi, where's Mrs. Stanwyk?
Would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Fletch.
No, I want an answer, Is the story done?
Two...
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
So let's go! We run the pictures.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Frieda's boss.
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
Poor taste.  I know.  Listen, I respect homosexuals.  When I was young, my maid was a homosexual.  My maid was a homosexual.
Damnit... you were right last night. Jonathan and I were into more than sex.  Along with Bobby Vomit, right after old Jack Grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off Grendel records... I didn't want you involved...
So many assholes, so few bullets.
I'm not cynical.  Can I help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. So you're producing exclusively for Grendel Records now.  Hope you're taking Julian for a bundle.
I do it for love.
Let's just declare war on the hellhole.  Before they make <u>Crocodile Dundee</u> three.
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
Tonight after I see Don. Some Beverly Hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. Name's Colleen Sutton.
Spooky.  I'll process her.
Yeah, let's bury her.
C.D.s.  The music kind.  From the Grendel label.
How much?
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends...
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Ford, you were right!
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
You-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-Vancouver-and there's these-C.D.s...
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Yeah, uh, I got some pretty good leads...
What are you running from?
Two words.  Disco Express.
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
That's okay.  I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
Polo.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
The case!
How's it going?
Shock.
And may I suggest for dessert, the five copies I made...
You're that guy, the private eye.
Do you really know everybody in the industry?
How nice.
So...
Zuzu Petals.  Sounds like a drug. A lethal one.
You don't use shit?
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
It's your problem.
Il fallait le faire.
I'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  Our American friends.
We must follow it.
It's beautiful.
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.
There's nobody like that on six.
Mr. and Mrs. Alain Charnier, would be another.  He's in shipping.
Where's he from?
Strike out, eh?
Drink this.
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Suspicion of what?
What about Sal?
I'm afraid the rest of Ward's Island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, The Charnier Shipping Company, of Marseilles, France.
It was a crematorium.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
Oh, my God!  What is that?!  Why you showing me this shit!?  JESUS!  JESUS! Get those away from me!
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
It was under control, Bud.  Butchy's just getting tight in his old age.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
415 Greenwich St.  #302.  Under the body of a murdered woman.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Listen, you can't broadcast without a license.  Unless this is an emergency, you gotta get off the band.
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
Is this some kind of joke?  Gordo is that you?  Are you fucking with me?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
Oh my god.
I don't know.
Thirty-five?  That would make it...
What's that?
No wait, don't go!
Why?
Chief?!  Is that you?
She...she died.  It's like it just happened.
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
John, you still there?
You all right?
No, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
He touched your wallet!  Where's your wallet?
What are you doing here, Satch?  You off today?
Cancer.  It was the cigarettes.  Right? The cigarettes?
Oh don't worry kid, I know where you live.  Now I want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy Yahoo. You got that Space Cowboy.  Y-a-h-o-o. It's a magic word and I never want you to forget it.
You're not looking too good.
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
She's pretty special.
Wife around?
According to the Guinness Book, you passed the World's Record several whacks ago.
I don't know...
I vote for me.
It's deceiving.
... To prove something to myself... to prove I'm stronger than I think I am.
And, what about us?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
Hi.
Faster!  Eat faster!
Yes.
Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
Got any good ideas?
This is no time to celebrate!
This has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
You don't to say it.  I can tell.
What?
Will you slow down?  It's hard enough to read this thing.
Oh, jeez.
Is that all you found?
That's your problem, Larry. That's why your sales are always below quota.  Your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
Okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
You know what?  Sissy and Cort are playing jokes.  You know, trying to scare each other.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
Yes!
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
...but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
The what?
Anything else?
No, I --
I know everything about you, Diana.
Steven buggin' you?
Sorry, Di.  I was just going to my car.  I didn't mean to frighten you...
You're talking about my lady.
Why didn't you tell me?
Does he know about what happened?
Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find out it was you, I'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
Don't do anything stupid.
What am I gonna do -- I'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
Until I hear the truth.
You don't know shit!
About what?
About Jessica.
Never.
That's disgusting.
Have you seen Tamara?
It's my graduation gift from Daddy. It cost over a thousand bucks but it's the best.
A major prick.
He's undefeated, you know that?  Julius is the only senior I'd even consider doing it with. If he wasn't black, that is.
What are you going to do?
What's that?
They're out of town.
She's fine, Charles. Take it easy...
What did you do with Rennie??
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
You're making a big mistake, Rennie. It's not too late to put you back on land.
If Miss Van Deusen knew how afraid you were of...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
I'm not staying in my room, Uncle Charles.
Everything okay?
It's not that simple.
I've got the numbers.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
What do you mean, we must abandon?
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
Is it safe?
What?
Shoot him, Nicky. Not that we really mean it. But where does he live?
This could be it.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
The Red Sox
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
Am I really so deeply repugnant?
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
Washed away.
What did it say?
What do you want?
Where are your glasses? Go get them.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Since when did that matter?
I can't find it.
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
Hey, Toyota. He asked me a question.
"It looked extremely rocky for the Boston nine that day."
Too late. All the elements are in place. Delay the opening and we lose the theater.
Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Game six is history,pal.
Sidney remains optimistic.
Yes.
Burnt sienna.
Yes.
What's good?
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
A little.
I hear good things about the new play.
Someone waiting for you?
It is the work of untouchables.
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
What do you expect when you talk like that?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
How does a reporter in Central America learn that Gandhi was born in Porbandar anyway?
I don't know... I'm still searching for a "response."
Do you remember much of South Africa?
Perhaps some tea?
You're an extraordinary man.
...There's been no time to keep figures, but there must be ninety -- a hundred thousand under arrest.  And it still goes on.
Who are you trying to convince?
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
I guess so.  Well, while you're up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir?  I mean besides what's on his sheet.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
How often do you test, Director?
Often.
Surely you know what you have.
Hello.
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
It's not too late to back out.
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Where are we going?
You may as well invite her here.
Hello?
Anything I've forgotten?
Antonio, the choir...
Vincent...Vincent...
I hope he's not just a body.
Hugo!  I've found him!
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
You're angry--
What about the car?
Who are they?
All it takes is a long arm.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
I get my own help.
Rudy Butler, Frank Jackson...
They will be ready. You guys do your job.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
Don't think too badly of her... After all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
You okay?
What do you mean? You've never been there.
Half a million.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Nothing's been boring since you found me.
I guess I'm kind of...
Is he straight?
Yeah... I know.
Usually on the right side as you go in.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
Promise you won't laugh.
Do you trust him?
And switched keys.
There may be a hunting party.
I want to say something.
Look, what you said yesterday... I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
Things can't get much worse can they?
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
What is it?
They will have our description before we can get a plane.
Hope you get to where you're going.
All right. Shells?
Okay. How many bank exits?
Chambers - Reilly. Time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
I'm good at that.
What do you have in mind?
Just sandwiches...
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Then you do it.
Where we go in1?
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
Come on. How much?
Wish you hadn't said that. When Slim Canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
You do what he says, Harold.
Collar bone is broken. No infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
How?
Who?
Nothing. What could I do?
What happened to this car?
I know.
I made a mistake.
I made a mistake.
No, don't Jack, don't.
Really.
Nothing more? Just another feller?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
What was bugging Frank?
I know him too.
Oh, do you?
Yes.
Could you do me a favour?
He must have been pretty sure I'd come.
You all right now?
What?
Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
What is it?
You don't look it.
And what you going to do?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
So shut up.
How'd you know I wouldn't?
'Cos I know you wear purple underwear.
No chance of that.
Didn't you know this is my home town?
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
Bollock naked with his socks still on?
All right. Two hundred.
I'll see you, then.
...they hold on to their money...
To get on the...
To get on the board.  Yeah.  How you goan'a get on the board sell'n a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll tell you what else.  You listening? I'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an Indian.
The whole fuckin' thing...The pressure's just too great.  You're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  All of them.  You go in the door.  I..."I got to close this fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or I don't win the Cadillac..." We fuckin' work too hard.  You work too hard.  We all, I remember when we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
Some contest board...
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...that's right...
For some sales pro...
The nurses?
That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The leads.  He's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  Why?  We have to go to them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
What?
What?
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
Someone should rob the office.
Yes.
So all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to Graff.
Did I say that?
He'd give me a job.
It's not something for nothing, George, I took you in on this, you have to go.  That's your thing. I've made the deal with Graff.  I can't go.  I can't go in, I've spoken on this too much.  I've got a big mouth.  "The fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
Yes.  I'm sure.
So I'm making it concrete.
I do?
Yes.  They are old.
Clear...
He said he filed...
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
What.  What kind of outfit are we running where...where anyone...
They stole the phones.
You think they're going to catch... where are you going?
A waste of time?  Why?
Where were you?
See...?  Were you the guy who broke in?
Then don't sweat it, George, you know why?
Yeah.  You know who doesn't?
Just go to lunch.
Will you take it outside, we have people trying to do business here...
Listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  I have no complaints with that, in fact, I was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. It says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
Which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
Would you come in here, please?
John...John...John.  Okay.  John. John.  Look:  The Glengarry Highland's leads, you're sending Roma out.  Fine. He's a good man.  We know what he is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying, you look at the board, he's throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's throwing them away, he's throwing the leads away.  All that I'm saying, that you're wasting leads. I don't want to tell you your job. All that I'm saying, things get set, I know they do, you get a certain mindset... A guy gets a reputation.  We know how this...all I'm saying, put a closer on the job. There's more than one man for the... Put a...wait a second, put a proven man out...and you watch, now wait a second--and you watch your dollar volumes...You start closing them for fifty 'stead of twenty- five...you put a closer on the...
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get on the board the thirtieth, they're going to can my ass.  I need the leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm gone, and you're going to miss me, John, I swear to you.
Then how do they come up above that mark?  With dreck...?  That's nonsense.  Explain this to me. 'Cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  I want to tell you something...
Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on the ground.  Murray?  When was the last time he went out on a sit? Sales contest?  It's laughable. It's cold out there now, John. It's tight.  Money is tight.  This ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a good man--but I need a...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
The...Shelly?  The hot leads are assigned according to the board.  During the contest. Period.  Anyone who beats fifty per...
Either way.  You're out.
I've seen those leads.  I saw them when I was at Homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers Rio Rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  They're broke, John. They're cold.  They're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  Even so. Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine. Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING LEADS they got their money in a sock.  They're fucking Polacks, John.  Four leads.  I close two. Two.  Fifty per...
I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?  John.  John: my daughter...
Well, I want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long I could pick up the phone, call Murray and I'd have your job.  You know that?  Not too long ago.  For what?  For nothing. "Mur, this new kid burns my ass." "Shelly, he's out." You're gone before I'm back from lunch.  I bought him a trip to Bermuda once...
Why?
You want to do business that way...? Alright.  Alright.  Alright. Alright.  What is there on the other list...?
That's alright.
Well, I'm saying this, Shel: usually I take the contracts to the bank.  Last night I didn't.  How did you know that?  One night in a year I left a contract on my desk. Nobody knew that but you.  Now how did you know that?  You want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  This is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  Now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Was it?
Wait...uh, look...  Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  Take it all...  Take it!
Abso...
Don't.
You did that?
Those fuckin' deadbeats...
"...you have to believe in yourself..."
They took the leads?
Fuck her...
"What we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  And that's it." And we sit there.  I got the pen out...
You closed 'em today?
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what time do you have...?
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Rick...?
Well, you want to swing by the Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?
It's funny, you know, you get a picture of the Corporation-Type Company Man, all business...this man, no.  We'll go out to his home sometime.  Let's see.  Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in L.A....Monday...I'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
Tuesday.
What is?
You tell me again.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
She told me I have to.
The power to negotiate.
The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
You going to turn State's?
Who said "Fuck the Machine"?
I'm going home.
I'm not going home.  I'm going to Wisconsin.
They took some of the con...
Yes.
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
On your pillow.
We have no money for a rug.
Vitone!  Our driver has drunk too much wine.
How are the kids?
Well, thank you, they asked for you all week.
Connie.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Then why do you come to me?
Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me.
The children can stay.
But thank you for speaking to me as a Godfather.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Ready, Frankie.
That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'?
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
You know otherwise, Freddie?
Then I'm going to confide in you; trust you with something.
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
We have time.
For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife!
Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact.  I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him.  But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.
I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport.
Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci?
Wait... there's something else.
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down.  Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer.
No strings.
Simple.  Be friendly like us.  Not hostile.
Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
The baby I lost...
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
Why...the Rosato Brothers.
This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game.
Let him gamble.
They feel cheated.
How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of.
You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood.
Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that.
Always... But sometimes I don't understand.  I know I'll never have your kind of brains, in big deals. But Mike, this is a street thing. And Hyman Roth in Miami is behind the Rosato Brothers.
Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why.
My lawyer, Tom Hagen.  He arranged this all through your man Turnbull.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
And?
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
What's this?
I have already rented the apartment to another family.
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
It still hurt.  A lot.
If you enjoy it, you should do it.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --
Gimme a break.  I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  Is that going to hurt him?
Long enough.  Fifteen years.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
Good.  That is what I hope.  I did not think you a bugger too.  I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.
I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
What's to sketch?
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
But expressively broken.  How did it happen?
You went to university?
Just a year.  I dropped out to join the Marines.
It's new.
No.  I'm fine.
I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
You ever been married, Mr. Whale?
You know.  Look at me like -- like I look at women.
I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?
What happened?
Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy?  Do you have to rub my nose in it?
You first.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You're the one who started it.
Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
I thought you'd given up on my picture.
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
You okay?
Where's Betty?
By the way, I like the Renoir.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
And you said there'd be some of me left.  Nobody's going to know me in this getup.
No.  I expect you can't.
Your father was a schoolmaster?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
What rumors might those be?
I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale.
He took a job. And he fumbled it. Now he's jammed-up. Jammed-up bad...
It seems she neglected to mention it
Don't feel the need to explore my family dynamics, Atley...
And they still have the lowest rate of cancer of anywhere in the world. You know why? All they eat is seafood.
You have a Hollandaise sauce ?
Yeah -- ?
Your brother has four days. Fifty cars. Five-zero. For that he gets 200 large ...
This is how you're spending my time? Having a sock hop?
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved ...
Leg's all banged-up. He made a stupid play ... He'll limp around the yard up at Folsom. But Astricky will be there to take care of him. With their priors, they're looking at a serious bounce --
Let them go. And I'll leave ...
A little family emergency --
I'm on the move -
Yet your still here ... I gave you 24 hours, 24 hours ago ...
Where you been, anyway?
Diane 1.
You ever feel bad about any of this?
Donny --
How are we supposed to--
That can't be it. Cos we don't need saving
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
D.W.P. Thanks for holding. How can I help you?
Okay, then ... I just go to the Marriott and I'm set ...
"Carol." A 198 Mercedes ... She lives in the suburbs ...
All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
"About what?"
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
Hey, now -
You can handle it?
Thank-you ...
Having fun, Kip?
What did I tell you? What? What did I tell you?
Come here --
What are you doing here?
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Where'd you find this one?
You okay -- ?
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Kip took a job. Fifty ladies in two weeks. Only the two weeks have turned into four days. And not a single lady has been snared.
That's Mirror Man ... And that's Freb ... And Tumbler ... And Toby ... Fellas, this is Sara Wayland... They call her "Sway."
She was the only "Annie" you could find?
No way ...
Don't go getting all warm and fuzzy on me, Randall. I'm the jane that was left, and you're the jim that did the leaving. So save the sanctimonious shit for someone who believes. The only reason I ride with you, is cause I don't want to spend the whole night with any of them other creeps!
I take out my slim-jim...
Wrong preposition...
I can't. I got a back load of repairs and one of the mechanics called in sick and I haven't slept and--  Where to -- ?
"A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes, and then to get around them..." Nietzsche said that.
Is he still working here ?
No we don't -
What happened to Sway?
She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
So she flies -
You'll be at the docks ... Keeping Otto abreast of our progress ...
Not really -
What do you want, shithead?
The oldest one.  He was in an argument. A lousy ten-dollar card game. The kid pulls out a gun. It goes off. The kid gets killed. The grandmother hears it and finds out he's been arrested. She has a heart attack.  She drops dead right on the spot. Now Jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
Billy, how are you?
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
I'm not going to get fucked like Gribbs. He's seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  I don't need that. I don't care who it is. I'm warning everybody. Gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. That's not going to happen to me.  You understand?
Paulie. Why would I? I swear.
Nods.
And, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
What bag?
I don't care. Something's going on.
Henry.  Wake up.
I'm just having my last few drinks.
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
We've got to help each other.
Get packed.  We're getting out of here.
I had everybody working.  Even our old babysitter.
What did he say, exactly?
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
Well, we gotta dig him up again.
Paulie's gonna make him?
What'll I tell Fran?
I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.
You want the melon?
I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
I gotta talk to him as soon as I can.
Driving you crazy?  Don't get me started.  You're here a month and sometimes I know he doesn't come home at all. What kind of people are these?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
Oh shit.
Suck my cock!
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.
I've been shit faced for like two weeks.
Yeah, so he's like "Check the front of my truck, I can prove I hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
Look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' Patriots' games and still workin' construction, I'll fuckin' kill you. And that's not a threat, that's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill you.
You don't know that.
You and Morgan throw?
See, now this doesn't feel right.  When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
What Morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
Did she get my Double Burger?
My uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
Oh my God, I got the most fucked up thing I been meanin' to tell you.
How'd you like that course?
All right, are we gonna have a problem?
You're in a safe place, Will.
Where is it touching you?
--But what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. He can always failsafe to either side--
Well, if something was stolen, I should know about it.
I told you to cooperate with these people.
This is correct. I see you used Mclullen here--
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
I'm in your applied theories class. We're all down at the Math and Science building.
You were missed.  How long has it been since we've seen each other?
--That's right, Sean. He mailed it to a professor at Cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought Ramanujan to England.
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
Oh, what is this? Some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
Well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
--Gerry--
Hold on!
I might understand that.
Yeah, I read those.
What did you think?
Watch your mouth.
Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
I didn't ask for this.
I know.
See ya.
You suck.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Five minutes.
I was trying to be smooth.  But at twelve-fifteen I was gonna come over there and talk to you.
Sounds good, where are you now?
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
Yes you were.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
Your house must have been a zoo.
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
Clearly.
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Just for fun?
How do you know that?
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Is that what you think--
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more.  I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat--*good* an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't *no*body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
Why, I ain't hardly touchin' you!
Naw. They paroled me.
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
Joad.
Two and a half cents.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Look, I didn't set the price. I'm just working here. If you want it, take it. If you don't, turn right around and beat it.
I don't mean to be nosy, y'understand. I just got to have certain information. What's your name?
Are you aimin' to tell me that the fellas that run this camp is jus' fellas--campin' here?
We got the best dances in the county every Saturday night.
Say, who runs this place?
Anything like work aroun' here?
But you wasn't a preacher. A girl was just a girl to you. But to me they was holy vessels. I was savin' their souls.  I ast myself--what *is* this call, the Holy Sperit? Maybe *that's* love. Why, I love everybody so much I'm fit to bust sometimes!  So maybe there ain't no sin an' there ain't no virtue. There's just what people do. Some things folks do is nice, and some ain't so nice. But that's as far as any man's got a right to say.
Didn't you hear? It was in the papers.
No, I never. What?
She's settlin'.
I ain't no more a preacher, you know.
Gimme that gun. Now git outa here. Go down in them willows an' wait.
Pull up behind that car.  Okay for this one. Take 'em through.
I don't like nobody drawin' a bead on me.
Have it your own way, son, but just as sure as you touch my house with that cat I'm gonna blow you plumb to kingdom come.
How about a lift, mister?
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Fi' cents! They pain' you fi' cents?
What's he fixin' to do, ma?
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Got any plants?
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
How 'bout it?
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
Sometimes they do.
How about it, Ma?
Thank God!  An' we're still together-- most of us. 
No.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Got any more, Ma?
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
They was some cops here, Ma. They was takin' down the license numbers. It looks like somebody knows sump'n.
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
But what's happened?  How come they got to get off? We been here fifty years--same place.
Well?
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
I ain't got nothin' in *my* han'.
But what about this?
Tom, I jus' don't feel like nothin' a tall. Without him I jus' don't wanta live.
This here's the desert an' we're right in it!
Keep qui'te, will ya! Shet your mouth!
What's this?
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
Yeah...
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
It's what I do.
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Never better.
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
I'm a professional killer.
You see someone?
That's part of it.
Bad experiences.
Bad television.
You're fucking psycho.
No.
Is it something you've done?
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
You never could have kept this from me.
You understand the psychology of the job.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?
Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.
Like a union?
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
Sometimes. I'm in divorce, mainly. Some property. Some personal injury.
Did you see Blank in there?
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
He didn't.
There's nothing to be done about it.
This is not good.
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
It's a place where religious people--
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
So what happened to you?
Kind of crept up on you, didn't it?
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Doesn't matter.
You okay?
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Why don't you go lie down?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
No, you didn't.
What about him?
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
Did he tell you that?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
About what?
Well, I suppose we could use another good public feud...
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
I'm sorry.
We're very lucky.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
You've got to stop doing that?
You've already made arrangements!?
She will if you think she should.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
Was the trip okay?
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
What was it like?
I'd love to go there one time...
You don't seem to upset?
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
Promise?
Good luck to you, Annie.
- See, what you can do for him --...
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
Tom?
Would you let me ride your horse?
Isn't it like, obvious?
Can you drive?
Jude, you okay?
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
What, sweetheart?
I know. Amazing.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
Kind of trouble I'm in the mood for.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
How's it going, Ray?
I'm sorry, sir. We caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
Hackers of the World, Unite!
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?
Snoop onto them...
Well, I got a lot, alright? I don't know how many but... my head hurts.
Dead.
How was school?
Aaaah. Did we meet someone special?
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
I'm Crash Override.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
Okay. I'll copy it.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
What?
You look good in a dress.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I was just looking for the principal's office.
You're welcome.
What's happening?
What the hell was that all about?
You're late.
My parents baby-sitter canceled.
My parents are going to come home early tonight.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
We've been better.
Go!
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Why not?
Because the lights are all out.
About what?
We're not talking about any ordinary prisoner Hoffman! We are talking about evil on two legs.
How many people in the bus?
Four plus Myers.
Has he been prepped?
Watch it.
What is this? Four nights in a row?  You going for a record here?  The seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
How about this afternoon I pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
Rachel, can I go get my costume on?
I've got you come on, go down.
Then we'll be safe?
Rachel, take your sister upstairs. First door on the right.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
What are we doing?
Now I pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. You got that?
I'll be out on gateway and I doubt I'll be back before the troopers get here.
Michael Myers has escaped from Ridgemont. He's here in Haddonfield.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.
How's it powered?
Okay.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
Poor Laurie. You scared another one away.
It's tragic. You never go out. You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
I doubt that. Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.
Probably Mister Riddle.
What's the pumpkin for?
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Well, come on, get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Go get me a beer.
I thought you were gonna get one for me.
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.
Sure...
Exactly what do you need?
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Hey, Laurie...
Are you coming over tonight?
Sure.
Yes, I am.
What about the rest of my comic books?
I saw him...
Laurie, you come with us...
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
Will you get her for me?
Thorazin.
I couldn't if I tried.
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
I know.  You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh!
Oh, is that what it is?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Right.
Oh, geez, yeah.
Uh...
What?
And you, you-you're going?
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
I can't resist.
We're actresses.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
And it ruins everything else.
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
Now, don't get alarmed.  These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here.  I mean, it's, it's nothing.
Look I-I-I'll be okay.  I'll be okay.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Well, are...are they big?
We--
What are you doing here?
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Yes, I do.
Where are you headed?
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Yeah, you would.
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
No, no.  I-I-I understand completely. No problem.  Y-you're busy.  I-I-I...
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime.  Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Oh, no, no.  Well, yes!  I love you.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
I can't say anything!
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
I almost didn't.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
She has all the cooking talent.
Are you in a bad mood?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes?  I-I-I am disenchanted.  I am in love with someone else.
...this is a toast!  This is a toast.
But why?  We raised you as a Jew.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
You've been with someone!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
Oh, Jesus!
Don't say that!  I don't want to hear that word!  Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
But you don't have any symptoms!
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
Really?
Yeah?
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
How is everything?
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
I think so.
I know, I know.
That's really nice!
Oh!
Go right over there.
Wow!
Gee.
What are you talking about?
Hannah and I...can't have any children.  Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it--  It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Ouch!
Oooo.
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Yeah, that's clerical.
My script?
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
I was so bored!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
...in a really horrible way.
No, the reason I ask is--
I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Really?
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Oh, well.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Oh, God!
I am.  You-you made my day.
Just a few minutes ago.
Oh...
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
I'm going to tell you later....
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Why me?
...very good.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they did it for a lark.
Who would that be.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
You're ready now.
You want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
I know her by the Back.
Are you <u>alright</u>...?
Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months missing.
Yeah, so where is he?
Somewhere in Italy.
Make plans for Lechter's abduction.
If you would see him monument, look around you.
..It won't be long now, sir...
He don't like popcorn.
Now, why in the world would he do that?
Exactly.
Please, I do not... I don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
And I expect you to.  Let's talk like two medical men 
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
Not for our Doctor Lechter.  This...  Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left Hand.  It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L...
We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the Justice Department.
Well, you know, that happens, on the street.
I don't <u>think</u> so...
A wonderful country...
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
And what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
Of course, Commendatore...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
You know America?
Darling...
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
We got KittyKat...
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
They <u>will</u>, sir.  We <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... I keep them hungry.  When... when do we think this man arrives.
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
I'd prefer you to say what you feel.
And how did he do that?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
...my love...
Because...?
The Case that I am <u>working</u> on...
I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Tell me why...?
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
I don't know.  Do <u>you</u> know...?
...no...
And you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  You've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  But, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
I..
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
It's funny, when I first met you I thought you were such a weirdo...I still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.
Now what? What did I do this time?
Man, she's losing it...
Sorry about all that...I'm your CIT-- Jasper.
Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
I'm sorry. It just...It seems silly. Like kissing a girl.
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
Talia, just because you happen to be Jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the Lord's body...
I have to get up. Still more to do. That boy hates Asian people. That girl thinks she gave her Mom cancer by dropping a plate on her hand. Her daddy touches her. His daddy never touches him. It would have been cooler if I'd died.
Isn't this the time where one of us says something deeply offensive to the other one...We're just so different.
So what?                                                    ]
What in the hell did you do that for?
We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?
Gosh, this is really a great conversation--I can't believe I said that out loud.
Excuse me, Wichita, I can't seem to reach the top shelf in the storage room. Could you...
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Hey, you're not settling for the two shots are you? Knock me out girl. It's the only way.
Jeez, right, then why don't I do drugs?
In my heart, Heather's still alive.
Sawyer. Guess what today is?
I was talking with someone!
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
Maybe you should see a doctor.
You are out of control. Heather and Kurt were a shock, but Martha Dumptruck, get crucial! She dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Probably....
Trust me. She skips the Saturday morning trip to Grandma's even when she's not hungover.
No luck? Well, milk and orange juice'll do quite nicely. Quite nicely.
That's good, but Heather would never use the word "myriad."
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
You're still not listening! I'm not..
This knife is filthy.
I knew that loose was too noose! I mean, noose too loose! Goddamn you!
We on tonight man?
Terrible thing. So will we get to meet this dark horse prom contender?
Look who I've found!
waves a pair of new socks around. The family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
 Got an A, Mum!
He's the manager!
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
sighs.
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
You have to let me go!
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
That's coming along well!
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
Oh-what a nice outfit!
It doesn't matter.
You're such an incredible woman.
Let's go overseas . . .
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa?
Okay Mr. Statistics I've got one for you. What's the most common cause of death for adults over the age of eighteen?
Eighty third most common.
Pitbull attacks.
You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing.
No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
I have my connections
You were supposed to have a date with Gwen last night? GWEN DEARDON? The supervisor?
Hello I'm Dr...
I said she's been missing for-
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead.
Get back here, junior bean counter. This is your supervisor speaking.
Gwen, my wife's dead.
Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture.
In a word? Lucrative.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
What?
Where's my wife?
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
You and your wife were playing a game shortly before you got into that car accident weren't you?
Seeing you were her sole benefactor, and I'm the executive of the will, Kirsty's entire estate would have to be donated to the city.
I don't work here.
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
It's not that kind of date.
You okay?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Whoa, I have serious space issues, dude. What do you want?
You stole her purse!  While you were saving her?
Which don't sound like such a bad goddamn idea, John.
Huh?  Whadda you mean?
Well, we gotta work this thing out, John.  It's a goddamn mess an' I'm halfway to doing serious time in the joint an' the TV lady's so stuck on you she don't want it to come out you stole her purse because it might break the heart of millions.  Looka those maniacs, willya?  They love you, for Chrissake!
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
We can hope.  You still have your job, right?
Often, uh.
"Angel!"  I didn't say "angel," that's a little strong.  Listen, here's the thing, I gotta get over there to the TV station to collect my million bucks.
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
Spanish kinda guys!
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
I am so tired of your bullshit, Bernie.
The homeless!
I was giving him some advice is all. Preparing him for life.  You don't want him to grow up soft, Ev	, it's tough out there, it's a goddamn jungle.
"Harassed."  Cause I yelled at him when he's riding in his limo?  The guy's a thief, he took my...
-- saved your...  whaaaaaaat?  What? Blackmailing...?
I'm going to apologize to Bubber?
"The Nomm"?  What's that?
It was this war.  Viet Nam.  Doesn't matter.
What picture?
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
That's not what I mean...
It's not right, Gale...
"A little mistake"!
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.
That too.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
What?
If I gave you the impression I hated him I didn't mean to.  I... I hate the way he <u>behaves</u>... he's selfish and self-centered and cynical...
I haven't won it yet.  I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
You better believe it, buddy. Your average Rolls Royce doesn't have to pass as many tests.  You want consistency?  You want dependability?  You want safety?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
So this really does the trick, eh?
So where are all your toys?
Any particular brand?
How's the new place?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Isn't that always the way?
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
You must value your independence.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
Yeah, you know, that in life you really have to choose what you want to do.
Hey.  Have a nice time -- it's a good school.
A man?  Was it a dream?
No, I told you.  A whiff of perfume on his shirt.
I'm sure that's all it is, honey. Maybe you both just need a vacation.
Where'd he go?
What if someone else buys it in the meantime?
-- And keep my kids away from his property -- who the hell does he think he is?  Some nice neighborhood.
Honey, it's not the end of the world.  You'll call Lowenthal tomorrow and find out it was just a mix-up.  And if he's not interested anymore, then you'll find another company to go to maybe even your own.  You are free now, you are independent.
This is for the best, you know it is.  Why do my socks keep disappearing!
And what was that neighbor guy doing here?
I was having a bad day -- I lost that job, I was dependent on other people, I was let down --
What for, dickweed?
I have a cold.
Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
They appear to be authentic.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
He had to come from somewhere.
Where have you been for the last seven years?
That doesn't mean you don't know what's going on.  You're connected to this guy somehow.  He's after you -- just like the others were.
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
The prize?  So much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  So much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  The prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
There will be more to the prize than that.  Power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
You cannot run from your destiny, Conner.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
And what do you think you will find in another land?
How long is the voyage?
To ask her to dance.
Well?
I've come to strike a bargain with you.  I wish to learn the power of changing.
And what would'st I gain from this bargain?
Why is it you never talk to me about Scotland -- your life there.
No.  I'm an archaeologist.
What do you want?
Yes.  We found another man outside a site we were working at in Scotland.
Yes.  How did you know?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
Where did you get it?
Yes.
You didn't answer my question.
How could that be?  People don't live for three hundred years.
I've seen it.
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
It was not by choice.  A small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  We were trapped inside.  When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  What you thought was the end -- was not.  This is the end.  We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I'll no forget you.
Why?
Did they?  You are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  You feel the same -- want the same.  You want to live.
Good afternoon, Mr. Parker.
I can take care of myself.
Don't tell anyone what you're doing, not Louise, not the other guys, not the Sheriffs.  You understand me, Larry?
I will, Chief.  Absolutely.
I understand.
Try to act cool, okay?  He's gonna think you're a dick.
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
That cop didn't pull his gun.  Mars lied. He just started shooting!
Bullshit.  Why would Mars do that?
You with the cops?
I'm here.
You got something to say?
Is Krupchek an aggressive guy?  Hot- tempered?  Anything like that?
He has a wife and kid.  That's how we'll get to him.
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
I need to work out some stuff.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
No one's coming.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
Shh, they'll hear you!
What do you want?
What?
Now we can do whatever we want.
Please get away from me.
You gotta pee?
I'm the chief of police here.  I have to talk to him.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
He didn't say.
Louise?
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
They have security cameras.  Rooney would see you coming.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
I don't know what you're talking about.
What happened?
Paul!
Paul...  ...I have to talk to you.
If the UN changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
Hold the line here. Do not shoot! The Colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. Paul approaches Oliver
What's happening?
They murdered my soldiers. Ten Belgians who I sent to get the lady minister.
Excuse me, Colonel.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Their people?
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
Paul, I need you to buy me a day or two. I don't have the fuel for this convoy. I will have to scrounge it.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
I will see what I can do.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
You said you had no whiskey.
Whiskey?
Get in.
You lie.
Ground rules! Where the fuck do you think you are, Wimbledon?
Very soon.
Mr. Manager.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
For supplies, you drive.
Promoted. House Manager.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Everyone must leave the hotel now.
Was there blood?
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Do something.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
They do not have your connections.
The president has been murdered.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
What!
Any luck?
He needs to be in a safe place.  Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Go out! Where?
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
It depends where you sit Zozo. In coach it is like the bus to Giterama.
That is why they call it coach?
Where?
Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
Not yet.
-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
And how the hell are we going to do that?
Why in God's name wasn't this thing removed years ago??
Jesus H. Christ!
Looks like we're it.
More the merrier.
Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife.
Excuse me?
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
-- I did: down here.
Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
-- well, let's hear it for small miracles --
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
-- of this place, goddamnit, Pritchett!
Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash.
And we get this money when?
I don't think so...
Good point.
That's crazy!
No. It's just trying to frighten us.
Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
Could we have a word?
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top?
What're you talking about?
Jennifer-Jenzen-Executive-V.P.- Paragon-Pictures.
This is all maybe getting a little too strange --
Sorry.
-- listen to me, goddamnit --
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
"Dummy 6" keeps losing his arm.
-- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that!
No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it.
But the million bucks each, that's for real?
Pritchett, this "lockdown" thing -- it's gotta have like a master control -- you know machinery, gears, whatever -- somewhere in this place?
The basement -- but, believe me, you don't want to go down there.
Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
Please.....anyone....help me?
Did you find something?
Can I do it again tonight?
Can you talk to her?
She says she's lonely...
That's father, Aubrey. SEAMUS Well yes I did.  Lived here my whole life.
I hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
Who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  Maybe good help is hard to find.
It was in the cellar.  Weird.
Who?
I think everything's ready.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.
You must be the new tenants.
How long will it take!
Looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  Maybe some kind of a rodent.
Do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
There's something through that wall!
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
Hello?
It's ... I don't know.  First World War, right?
Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something ...
Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Sorry.
No ... I mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything.  It's just I don't dream.  Never have.  ... Maybe it'd help if I slept sometime ... Just kidding ... No, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I'm jealous.  It's like everybody has another world except me. You know what I mean?
Sure.  Why?
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
Wow.  Thank you.
I understand.  Their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  What else could you do?
Don't flee from yourself.  If you have a quality, let it define you.  Cultivate it.  It is you.  By helping me, you will help yourse...
What!?  What are you talking about?  Why should I help you?
How do we start?
JP?
Really?
You're apologizing?
Not quite.  This wasn't here.
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
The security's actually not that severe.
Delivery Entrance.  Low Security.
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
Shwoof, that makes me feel better. I can't believe this is the Iron Curtain.  All the guy at Airport customs wanted to know was "Who Shot J.R.?"
That was close....
Alex, are you....
Ta ta, Hudson Hawk.
Don't you just hate kids...
Damn baby, when's the last time you had a vacation...Jesus, I gotta get out of this job.  If my Mom knew her daughter assassinated the leader of the anti-Apartheid movement....
What the hell....
Did he mention the Mayflowers?
No, your Eminence.  I think he's going to steal the Codex, as early as next week.
Attempt, you mean.  The vanity of this man, Hudson Hawk.  The Vatican has foiled the advances of Pirates and Terrorists.  We will not lie down for some schmuck from New Jersey.  Must you flirt with him so realistically?
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
That's what you theenk.
Secret passageways don't mean as much as they used to.  There's a place two blocks east of here. Enzo's.  Say 10:30.
Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
What have you been doing?
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
The C.I. what?  God, no...
This doesn't taste like cappuccino.
I hope you know what....
Cat got his tongue?
What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
If you're pausing for a "thank you," give it up.  So boss, you going to tell me what the crystal piece inside the pony means?
Way to go, Alfie!  How many people did you break that thing in front of.   Good help's hard to find.
The auction house, asshole.  One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been.  No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.
All this trouble for a horsey. I may not know art, but I know what I like.
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
Don't be stupid...they...
I'm supposed to fall for that?
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
Nobody told me! Nobody told me! You sold all of our stock?
...But I guess you don't really know him any better than that board does, do ya, Miss Archuh?
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
What a horrible little person.
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
...Certain people are --
What a beautiful thought.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Yeah, well, monkey or not I'm still editor of this rag. Amy, I thought you were doing that piece on the F.B.I. -- J. Edgar Hoover: When Will He Marry?
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Ya know, entry level!
Tell me about it.
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
Wuddya mean, buddy?
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
Geez, I --
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
...Yeah, go ahead.
Well, frankly, I...
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Finally.
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
Ya don't say.
I got gas, Bennie.
Yeah, tell me about it.
There's one in every story.
Twenty bucks says not here she don't find one.
He don't look wise.
She's good, Bennie.
Thank you for waking me.
Doctors and nurses can only do so much, Alma.  They can't cure everything.
There are other doctors...Yes, other doctors...Better doctors...
A man, miss -- an old man who lives in the garden at Fort Holland - with arrows stuck in him and a sorrowful, weeping look on his black face.
You mean a figurehead.
Mrs. Rand.
But, Mrs. Rand --
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
Mrs. Rand...
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
The West Indies?
Don't worry.  I wasn't missed.  The only important man here is the owner.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
No, Wes.
I'm sorry...
It's always stood there, Miss Connell.  I can remember it in my grandfather's time and my father's. I'm afraid it will have to remain.
What you saw tonight -- two brothers at each other's throat and a woman driven mad by her own husband?  Do you love that?
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
I remember words I said to Jessica - words mixed like to poison -- to hurt her, to madden her.
This is something else.  They're curious.  Curiosity and religious fervor make a strange and explosive mixture.
In other words, I'm on trial.
Yeah, see you bright and early Monday am.  Say, where's the wife?
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
Good night.
That shirt?
What?
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
Don't be dim.
I'm not surprised.
I'm not staying at this party so we can go home with someone else's wife. That's not why we're here, right? We're simply being neighbors here, and I think we should do just that --
Elena, it's not what you think. It's not a big plot. Honestly. Honestly. I don't know if you want to go over this now, but it's just something that comes over me. I don't feel good about it. I know I've done what I didn't want to do. I don't know --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --
Ben--
Talking to me, dad?
Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Welcome to the Monkey House has been a seminal influence on me -- hey Benjamin -- give it a try? This stuff will make some sense out of those larger questions.
Look, Elena, the fact that we're neighbors... you know, close friends, well it sort of makes this a little strange, don't you think?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Hi mom.
I don't like coffee.
It's really quite all right.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Yes.
That's right.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
You weren't. You actually, for some reason, you have the effect on me of making me feel just a tiny bit ashamed of myself.
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
Man, Francis, you are one drug addled elitist freak, and when the revolution comes I do not want to be lined up with you and shot, 'cause you're fucking ripe for political reeducation, you know, like in the fields.
How can you do that man?
No candy for me?
Just be careful.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
You do? I'm glad. Because I feel for you --
Truly? Do speak.
How do you know this shit?
Yeah?
Wow!
Yeah. Yours?
Charles.
May I operate your telephonic apparatus?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
Mike's out -- I think he went to Silver Meadow to see if you were hanging around there.
That's I.A.'s pit bull.
I have to get back.
Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap.
But they're so boring.  All small stuff.
Do it again.
Then change it.
Not really.
Thanks.
How do you mean?
He knew exactly what we'd be looking for. Made sure to cover up all his tracks.
Maybe not.  We could talk to Buck...
That's not what he thinks.
Huh?
You heard me that time.
After that she left the party to go to him.
We were like sisters.  Knew everything about each other.
I'm sorry?
Thought you might find that.
But you wanted to.
Expensive dresses.  A heart necklace.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
Nothing if not vampires...
And no vampire here has discourse with God or the Devil?
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
Are these not the answers you came for?
Lestat! You knew Lestat!
Not without Claudia. Where is she?
I can't save her.
But you're the fairest by far.
It will grow back again!
Yes. And I'll tell you something else! I've met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
Louis, put me in my coffin...
How did you learn to write, Claudia?
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
Claudia - don't -
But if she dies...
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
There's nothing in the world now that doesn't hold some...
Fascination...
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Lestat!
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
No... You come back to me Louis...
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
And they frighten you?
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
Oh, that rumour about crosses?
Yes.
I got work to do. Take the bake elsewhere.
Okay, okay. You're right.
Julie, you left four messages... Four.
But, he said he'd try.
Nice move.
Karla!
I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood.
Every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
Can't what?
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Checking the locks again?
Who?
Voodoo.
You sure?
I'm fine.
What do you mean, Julie?
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
I trusted you.
...Why?
I'll come with you.
Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
Julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
This is General Nikolas Pherides, Commander of the Third Army. I'm Oliver Davis.  To be perfectly frank with you, we didn't expect to find anyone living here.
He is exhausted.
Drunk again?
Our friend, Poseidon, didn't use it for fishing. He raked the sea with it and stirred up the big waves.
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer  a correspondent of some sort 
Really, this is idiotic!
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep - I want to avoid it.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
You ask that of me? You're afraid to live in your coffin. You know what that means?
You do not know her last name -- you do not know from where she came?
She's not too well.
This girl -- Thea - is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
Oh, now  now look here 
I know all you are going to say -I have been saying it to myself, but the thought will not leave my mind. She resembles my wife -there is something about her the way she moves  the way she turns her head.
Is this what you wanted to speak to me about?
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle -
Thea, what's wrong?
Who?
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
You what? To save me?
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
It isn't me!
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Well, naturally. Of course.
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
That's the kid.
Not a soul.
You sent for me, sir?
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Well, sure I do.
Old college graduate now, huh?
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to Florida.
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.
No charge.
What's that?
Oh  Welch. That's what I get for praying.
Came back three days ago.
Hmmmm . . .
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Oh, George!
Yes, sir.
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Yes, you bet.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
How's that?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
No, George, don't . . .
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
Some other time, George.
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
I'd like to do that.
I have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. George, you remember that night in Martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?
Made up your mind yet?
Do I look as funny as you do?
You may kiss my hand.
Ouch!
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
Yeah, just started.
I guess you forgot something.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
Sure you do -- you win either way.
Oh, shit.
Yeah, it's her job.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.
Loser sails home alone.
I don't know.
Let's just go sailing, okay?
No!  It's still there!
You didn't miss much.  Christ, what a mess.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
What else is there to do?
Mike?  Is that you?
Y'know, Brody -- for the first time in years it's worth putting money into this town.
Is that what it is?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
Okay, so that's it.
Can't you tell?
Let's get the kid home.
One what?  Ah-ha!
Sort of -- Mathew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora, presently in the Antarctic Ocean, and won't be in radio range until half-past next spring.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
What'd I say?
We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
We're alone.
Chief -- the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer.
That's it?
That's it.  Just do it, all right?
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Last transmission said ten juve- niles.
Hang on!
They made me go with them.
The lighthouse is a make-out spot.
Nope.
Maybe it's gone.
Mmmmmm.
I thought you were grounded.
I don't care.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
You should've been out there.  You should've seen him waving that gun, like a maniac.  There were shots fired!
I'm only walking him.  You caught him.  You have to be exhausted.
Don't feel bad.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
I don't understand.  Overman's too good a diver to disappear.
How come?
I don't like what he does.
Okay, forget him now.  I'm going to pick up Sean.  Take a ride?
That's cute, Kathryn.  Real cute.
What's wrong?
... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
And leave me down here???
Make up your mind.
Michael...
Yes.  It's faster.
That's just it, Michael.  We don't!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
Me.
Go where?
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
I'm sorry.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
Let's hope he knows that.
Could be a new dance...  Walking the Shark.
I like it when they wake up.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
Not good enough.
Yeah, from Boston.
Massachussettans aren't.
You gonna work at The Kingdom?
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Not for me.  I don't go in the water, remember?
It's okay, Sean.
Take it up.
Yes, there is goes.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
No, South Georgia.
What kind of trouble?
It's not closing, Mike.
Look great, don't I?
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
You'll spoil her.
Can I make sandwiches...?
Yes, I did.
I've always wanted to ride one of those....
We need beer....
I take out the garbage, because...I'm glad we got that straightened out....
I shouldn't interfere...  My mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
We have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
Mom, please don't start that again....
I m not unhappy.  Frustrated maybe... Discouraged a little.  It'll work out....
There's nothing to worry about....
First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
Flies the plane....
Depends on where you want to go....
How can you just take the plane like this?
Where do I pull off...?
Got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
I tried winter once.  Burlington, Vermont.  Flew a run to New York.  I have a bone in my foot that still hasn't thawed.  When I was a small boy....
There must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
They had them on the big one....
I have coffee in the thermos.
Hurry!
What do you mean, it'll find her?
You sure you know how to do this.
What say we get the hell out of here, Ellen Brody. ...
Can't this thing go any faster?
She's a tough lady....
Feathers all over the place....
The readings suck....
Maybe it's the tags that suck....
Bad boy....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
We're out of money, partner.. We wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... How come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  You got two of them...?
My name goes on that report.  It's a half-assed job, I don't get my doctorate.  Neither do you....
Hoagie.
I am...You must know something about him....
Shove it....
Holy Christ....
Wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  Just like taking a picture.
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Here it comes....
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
That man keeps calling about his training film.  I can't convince him we don't have a S.W.A.T. team.
Yeah?
Oh, no. I wouldn't go ...
So what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
What do you think?
Not for me ..
Maybe?
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
Pig Woman agreed to take a test.
What do you want it for?
For a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
You looked like you did?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
Sure.
That's a very stupid question, Ross.
I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Listen, you don't havta come?
I thought it was Taylor's case?
It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
Alright, you got it. And I'll be putting an Observer in with you.
Kid told me he didn't take it?
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
When we spoke on the phone, did you know I was blonde?
Have you been here long?
I'm sorry. I'll get my things.
No.
Are you wearing a uniform?
I'm sorry .. I don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone's looking at me ..
You just asked me to ask you questions.
Yeah, that'll do .. Is that "Hamlet?"
I know.
Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly, Amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Amber was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
I haven't worn heels since I was 16. I don't think I could walk in these?
Is that Margie?
Friday night at City Hall. Got a great chance to frighten the fat.
He's not that bad of a guy ..?
I wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
Don't ever stop fucking me!
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Didn't hear it.
There is something missing here.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
Can I help?
We are?
It's all going to work.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Oh good.
Wow.  That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
Wait. Where is he?
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there?  Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
No.
You are not allowed to act this way.
John Taylor.  J.J. Stokes.  Andre Rison.  I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
That's your word?
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
You know when you know.  It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
No, I don't know.
No, you're --
Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
I'm sorry I asked.
Beautiful.
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
Gorgeous.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
Don't be silly.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. You saved those kids.
Her new boyfriend.
Stop that. Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory.
Nothing.
You mean it?
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
We'll be broke in four weeks.
You rented an automated litter box.
That does sound lucky.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
Baryonyx?
It looks intact.
You have to believe me. I did it with the best intentions.
Hmm?
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.
Did you read Malcolm's book?
Yeah.
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
Eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? Why did it crash?
Hmmm.
No, I'm sorry, but no. We'll savage what we can from the plane. Then we head for the coast. There may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
How did you know?
Light and strong, light and strong, sure, why not, it's only impossible. God save me from academics.
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen.
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
I'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.
Stop saying fantastic.  Where are you going?
I'm your daughter all the time, you know.  Not just when it's convenient.
What are you guys gonna do?
Where do you think you're going?!
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
What?
You version of it.
There' no reason for name calling.
It has a broken leg!
No.
What's that?
It'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?
Yes.  And people will live in the absence of truth.
You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them.
Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal.
What?
Ask her.
We're talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  We will never find the command NEDRY used.  He covered his tracks far too well, and I think it's obvious he's not coming back.  So shutting down the system - -
Remember - - viable embryos.  They're no use to us if they don't survive.
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Please - - let's hear something from the others.  Dr. Grant?  I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
There's only one way to be positive.  I need to see some droppings.  I have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
Oh my God.
Once we have control again we - -
Yeah, I know, you know...kids.  You want to have one of those?
They smell.
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
The Cretaceous.
Anything else, you old fossil?
And what are those?
Ellie, I've been thinking there's something about the periodicity doesn't had up.
I'm still not clear on Chaos.
That's conservative, of course.  There's no reason to speculate wildly.
Have a heart gentlemen.  Their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
Listen, ahh - -
These look kind of familiar.
Are you okay?  Can you move?  Tim!  Are you okay?
Tim, are you okay?
Okay, that's not so bad, ah Tim?
No.
For today, I guarantee it.
Not just kids - - for everyone.  We're going to open next year.  Unless the lawyers kill me first.  I don't care for lawyers.  You?
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!
He left us!  He left us!
A load, if I may say so. of fashionable number crunching, that¹s all it is!
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
Why are we hurrying if there's nothing wrong?
I hate trees!
I'm a hacker!
Don't tell me you're still thinking of buying Casa de Psycho...
No, but...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
There doesn't seem to be any water damage. Kind of cozy, actually.
Hello?
What happened?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Who's chest?
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
So Jason doesn't sleep... how does that help us?
It's all right. I'm simply in shock... this is what happens to people when they experience events they can't understand or comprehend. The mind shuts down temporarily and tries to shield itself from the horrific imagery it's been exposed to.  I'm going to need a lot of therapy.
Where's he going?
Great. Now there's _two_ serial killers on the loose.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
About ten minutes.
Where do you live?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
What is it really?
You look like brothers.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
I gave it to him yesterday.
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
Burgel, I thought it would be easier, as long as I was passing --
Your credibility -- yes, it's well known.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
I do.
The <u>Orlac</u> claim.
That he was -- satisfied in that regard.  I didn't want to pry.
What's funny?
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle.  Did you know that?
Why were you given notice?
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember.  <u>He</u> could've killed Eduard.
Burgel hated Eduard.  And me.  I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark.  People disappear up there regularly.   If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
I know there is.  And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
No -- not this time.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
Your office is the Workmen's --
Where you've been employed for seven years.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
-- You seem amused.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
Orlac is an account?
Is your friend's name among them?  Then he only worked on the one case.  Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
Of course not.  Only by a Director of the firm.  Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
I could always apply there.
Ludwig.
He can't sit still.  Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one.
Oskar!
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Holy God! The mummy walks!
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
What a climax to the film - The first white men to set foot on ...  "Skull Island"  Twentieth Century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
They' re dead.
You are most kind. We will be proud to assist you!
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Yes?
Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another place till we get things cleaned up.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Why isn't he locked up?
My name's John Klute.
Why?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
No, I'm look --
-- Tuscarora --
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Not much point to this, is there?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
-- Then you don't need me.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
Mm.
About what?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
They don't scare me any more.
Then, close the case.
Well there's a couple --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
Some mistake perhaps that --
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
What's in it?
It's in the report.
Do they have the report? Have you discussed it with them?
You don't tell them. That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them?  Peace in the family.  Beyond that, I don't know. All she wrote.
I think she's trying that.
Then how are you involved?
No.
No.
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Inspector we understand your position; ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for ourselves.
Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly.  At the moment I am seeing no one.
I see you have people there. What are their names?
Lunch in a restaurant.
Playing.
He hits me on the planet Kriptarium, when I steal the buried treasure from the famous peanut butter factory.
Greatest.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
You forgot the milk.
Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
That's not the right soap.  We use the kind in the green and yellow box.
Salisbury steak.
I hate it.
Yes?
Objection.  You're leading the witness.
Is this really your desk?
Did mommy ever see this?
Mom--I mean, dad?
What did you do when you were little?
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
At your mom's.  She'll have a bed for you in your own room.
Your mom knows all about The Face, okay?  Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it.
Objection!
Sustained.
Mrs. Kramer, did you ever work in a job while you were married to your ex-husband?
Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, you said you were married seven years. Is that correct?
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Somewhere in between.
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I heard you, Joanna.  I promise I heard you.
Joanna, go be a mother.  Get married, have kids.  Don't get married, have kids.  Do whatever you want.  I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
Ted, do you love him?
Joanna, what the hell is--
What?
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
'Night, Jim.
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Mr. Lombardo from packaging wants to meet on Friday.
Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer.  One inch over and it would have caught the eye.
OhmyGod.  Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?
I don't know, Thel...This whole thing has happened so...Pow, like that.
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Got it.
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
And you have horses? You love horses.
We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
Dalai Lama.
The Sera monks have surrendered?
Holiness?
Yes.
I need to squeeze this brain.
Will we be in this war?
No. This war is almost over.
Tell me.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
What is the size of our army, now?
I will not go.
Good day.
Please, come in, so cold.
I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
I turn you over again, today, Lhamo. One day, you will not be able to come running to us.
Me?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
Does he have the spot?
What do you think?
What does the butter spot feel like?
And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
Things change, Kundun.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
We have had fun, you and I. Fun for a little boy in an old palace.
Tell me.
You, kill me?
You are unharmed?
Too young?
Look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. Look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. Look for a kind heart.
<u>No</u>.  If you don't kill him instantly, I'm dead and you'll only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  And even if you <u>were</u> on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
--<u>Who</u> <u>is</u> <u>he</u>?
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
They don't really attack underwater and--
Again.  Not to be disruptive.  Do we have a problem with it dying?
Yup.
I can arrest you!!
He never said "go".
<u>Forget</u> <u>it</u>.
So maybe Wildlife will try to save him, they're more equipped to--
And again.  How would you get him on land?
Right.
<u>No</u>.  Look.  He's got nothing left.
You talk to Bickerman?
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?
Such the flirt.
He was an Indo-pacific.
Nothing's real.
Guess I finally got bit.
Excuse me.  One other thing, it's a <u>small</u> point, but... I have a thing about being humored, and I'm feeling humored, more by <u>him</u>, but you seemed quick to join in.
Never been to Maine before?
Who?
Baby crocs?
If one could be out there... why does Fish And Game tell me it's impossible?
No thanks.
Keep it dry.  No swimming.
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?
Calm down.
Well...
It was... something meeting you.
Even if we <u>could</u> tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
If you get a safe shot...
Is the dead guy in there?
I'm fine, thank you.
Have you ever seen a dead body before, Ms. Scott?
Seconds.  Three, four.
What?
I got nothing against--
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
You think Jack's handsome?
Hector, Jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. Time to go home.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Did you get him?
I'd like you to check out this lake.  See--
I'm not even a field person.
<u>Kelly</u>--
<u>You</u>?
Myra.
Why not?
Lecter said a lot of things.
Well, except for the one girl.
"- every day."
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Catherine. Listen to me. I have to find a rope. I have to leave this room, just for a minute, but -
You're playing a piano, Miss Starling?
Are they close to catching somebody, do you think?
Starling, Clarice M., good morning.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
We're trying to interview all of the serial killers now in custody, for a psychobehavioral profile. Could be a big help in unsolved cases. Most of them have been happy to talk to us. They have a compulsion to boast, these people... Do you spook easily, Starling?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
Then do that, Starling. Do just exactly that.
There's no correlation at all between where they're kidnapped and where they're found...?  What if - what if you trace the heaviest-traffic routes backwards from the dump sites? Do they converge at all?
Okay, Starling. Let's have it.
You haven't said a word today about that garage. Or what I found there.
I think he means it, this time. I think he'll deal.
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling?
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
Did you do those drawings, Doctor?
Jack Crawford must be very busy indeed if he's recruiting help from the student body. Busy hunting that new one, Buffalo Bill... Such a naughty boy! Did Crawford send you to ask for my advice on him?
I'll tell you if you'll look at this form.  It started as a bad joke in Kansas City Homicide. They said... this one likes to skin his humps.
I didn't.
No. But I will make you happy... I'll give you a chance for what you love most, Clarice Starling.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
I don't know. Is it?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Life's too slippery for books, Clarice. Typhoid and swans came from the same God.  Tell me, Miss West Virginia - was she a large girl?
Was it a butterfly?
A moth... How did you predict that?
What's your worst memory of childhood?  Quicker than that. I'm not interested in your worst invention.
I - ran away...
That's enough, I think. Happy hunting. Oh, and Clarice - next time you will tell me why you ran away. Shall I summarize?
We don't reckon time the same way, Clarice. This is all the time you'll ever have.
So you ran away...
Yes...
Your lambs are still for now, Clarice, but not forever... You'll have to earn it again and again, this blessed silence. Because it's the plight that drives you, and the plight will never end.
Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will.
I won't waste your time and Catherine's time bargaining for petty privileges. Clarice Starling and that awful Jack Crawford have wasted far too much already. I only pray they haven't doomed the poor girl... Let me help you now, and I'll trust you when it's all over.
Thank you, Doctor. I'll keep it in mind.
But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon.
You do not know what you are saying!
Dear Duncan, my affection is as towards a closest friend. Alice and I depend on you and respect you immensely... I wish they did, but my feelings don't go beyond that. Do you see?
My God, Alice.
I see...
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
Day and a half  Where did you get... the guide?
Dark haired...
Miss Cora Munro. He never set eyes on her before today.
I said... France is your enemy. Not ours.
Got a reason to stay.
The Scotsman's daughters are at the Poltroon's house. A company of the 33rd will accompany you and Magua will show you the way.
Does Webb not even know we are besieged?
Sergeant Major!
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!
Yes.
Gold could be arranged.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
My master owns these lands and your father has been ordered to drive off the English squatters. They have consented to go. So now he calls them enemies no longer.
But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post. Is he not tired?
Where is that sun?! It has gone behind the hill.  It is dark and cold. It has set on his people, they are fooled and kill all the animals and sell all of their lands to enrich the European masters who are always greedy for more than they need.  And Le Subtil is the son of his tribe. There have been many clouds and many mountains. But now he has come to lead his nation.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
Honor that is freely accorded to courage, may be refused obstinacy... These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter your works and I am possibly as well acquainted with your weak condition as you are yourselves.  Is Webb really en route and Montcalm hopes to take the fort by duplicity before British reinforcements arrive?
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
And they didn't believe the symptoms I described...
They found this?
Danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.
They know, don't they?
What are you doing?
Uh..Excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
Okay, number 23's full.
Forty-eight hours!
Made your million, yet?
Not yet.
You got money in this tub?
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
You read Russian?
Oooooh.  Damn!  Not so loud. Turn down the music.
"Routine," my ass!  Ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
I ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
Who cares?
The infirmary?...
Hey, Jonesy, who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
What is it?
Tip top, Willie...tip top.
Who's the best power forward in the NBA...Jameson?
It saw us!
Answer them and quit kicking me!
Bitch!  Look what you did!
Hardly.
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
Scarface, I have watched Scarface. You want to know how to do a drug deal, you watch Scarface!
You want a pint, go to the pub.
I thought you said no staff, Bazza!
You get the guns?
They were . . .
No mortgage, no debts; lock, stock, the sodding lot . . . don't worry, I got it under control.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
I hate these Southern shites.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
The stupid bastards! Count it!
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.
I mean it, there is only three of us here.
Out the back.
Samoan Jo's? Yon mean the pub? Hold on . . .
You see it's not easy to take a seat at this table; the money involved has to be a hundred grand upwards and there is no shortage of punters.
. . . What?
That you, boy?
And?
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
My van is half full.
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
How many feet?
How the fuck should I know?
--you're going to be on your own.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
That makes it okay?
You think I can't learn that?
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Yes, sir.
You're dismissed, Private.
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
You're testing me?
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
You got a cause of death?
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
You've been in this house for a while?
Uncle Al--
Same as they done in Mexico.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Well--
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Something like that.
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
They were using M-1's, yeah--
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Right.
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road.
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
Eladio Cruz.
You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now.
Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun--
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
They just wanted it to be one of theirs--
Your mother was a saint.
Historic occasion, isn't it?
That so?
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
Hey, Sam.
Imonna find out one way or the other.
The Perdido thing?
Steve called for you.
Steve?
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Of course you can.
It's Saturday.
Enough with the clothes--
How come?
That's how I ruined my stomach.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
Amado.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
Yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
You don't need to cuff me.
Just doing my job.
We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
Payne.
Been away. Up to Houston.
It's supposed to be some big sin, even if you love each other.
You heard right.
Who did this?
Anything?
Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it.
Harry.
That's my business. Harry.
Okay.  I'll keep digging.
Oh Christ.
He was the real thing, right?
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
It's okay.
Nothing's going to happen to you.
Are you sure?
No!  No!  No!
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Sure.  You want me to find out about Quaid?  I mean, the funeral?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
Mr. D'Amour?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Probably.
It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view.
I don't think the dead much care.
I want to speak to Dorothea.
I'm afraid she's not in.
Yeah, I know.
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
I tried to pay you off.
Yes...
That.
I'm in from New York.  I came to see Swann.
Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned.
He deserved it.
Didn't know you read minds.
Is that all?
Did she know where Nix was buried?
No.
They got here before us.
He's better off this way.
This is where we killed him.
You didn't try hard enough.
One question.
Have we met before?
Is he the Puritan?
Why would I want to?
Yes.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois,   and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
Not really. How long are you here for?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
No, you smiled.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
Where'd you grow up?
I know.
It's for my daughter.
Four.
So, where'd you go today.
Tomorrow.
That's what you said the other night.
Yes?
Ok, well... I love you.
Not all that pasta.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
That's ok.
Excuse me?
You smell weird.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
I miss you.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Sorry.  It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today.  Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
You really had me going, Claire.  I was finally ready to propose to you.
Seemed...on edge.
Why are you doing this to me?
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
What's his name?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
You should think about getting professional help.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
I don't understand what's going on.
Yes, I know.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like...  "The time of transformation is near..."
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
We're going to do this.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
And what are you thinking we should do now?
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
Lemme guess.  The lottery.
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
There weren't any voices.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
That's ridiculous.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
My mouth is kinda dry.
You could make a career by telling me where.
Damn, girl.
I don't wanna see that.
So how long is this trip?
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Mom's going to hate it.
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
No one's forcing her.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
You lost your head.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I know.  But chances are...
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
Well, what do you know.
One, up.
I just can.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
I think we gotta kiss now.
For how long?
So?
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
So she's honest.
I don't.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
God, here we go.
Why?
Four.
Yeah.
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Quincy...
What's up?
Sorry about your game.
he's just playing, Q...
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
You forgot to be there.
When did you decide all this?
Just something I'm trying.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
A rest?
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
Getting there.
Cause I don't get it.
you woke me up to tell me that?
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
What?
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Why not?
We need to talk.
Lucky kid.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
And now I'm paying for it, right?  That what this is about?  "I told you so?"
How are you paying tor the braces, Donnie?
THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSSINESS. I HAVE BEEN A GOOD WORKER, A GOOD AND LOYAL WORKER FOR YOU, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.
You ok?
Hey, Janet, it's Chad.
Hello?
Well I don't want to order anything, you see. I have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and I'm not sure who I should talk to or what I should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if I explain myself?
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
It's a helluva disease.
What do you want? Why are you here?
What the fuck do you want?
I'm not lying to you, I'm not --
uh...uh...What is it?
...yeah...
Yes.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
I don't have a boyfriend.
What's that stand for?
No, I'm off tonight.  I would lov-like, to go tonight, I can pick you up, I can pick you up here at about what time?  What time?
Eight o'clock?
What about ten o'clock, is that too late?  I don't get off and then --
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
No, no.
You really use strong language.
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
No, what's wrong?
You live alone?
Have you ever been there?
What?
Can you hold it?
-- Richard.
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
I can help you solve the case, I can tell you who did it.
I'm a rapper.
I ain't fuckin with you --
I have to talk to Frank, is he nearby?
He's doing the interview with the lady --
A very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
That's right.
Mmm.Hmm.
I'm sick.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
Brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here I think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
You mind your own bussines.
Braces.
I'm listening.  I'm getting better.
Do you wanna sit down?
....I dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
I'm gonna start rolling --
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
It's fine.  I can bleep it out.
I warned you -- I get on a roll...
This isn't meant --
Are you asking me that?
I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me.
Mm. Hm.
She lived in Tarzana.
Around here.
Why does that sound silly?
It's not your given name, right?
"Frank" was my mother's father.
Kind of.
When did he go off chemo?
No one else in here?
You're here.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
This is the LAPD, if anyone is in the closet I want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
-- that you shouldn't have done? That you regret, what? This? What's this? Fuck, man, c'mon.  Treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
Yes.
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
What were you saying, Stanley?
Come home soon after the show.
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
I love you so much.
Do you know the answer to this?
I'm asking you.  I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
Did you ever touch her?
Jimmy, did you touch her?
I don't know what I've done.
She's asleep.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
Commercials, a sitcom, an MOW or something.
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
You don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
You need to sober up.
Let me call you a car, Linda.
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand?  y'know?  I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
What would you like?
Cigarettes. Camel Lights.
Ok. One of those. Do you have Ram Rod? The magazine, Ram Rod?
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Do you still want the peanut butter, bread and cigarettes ?
Total is $15.29.  Thirty minutes or less.
Did you piss your fuckin' pants, Stanley?
You're late, not me.
You're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and I'II do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
Alright.
You have to be nicer to me, Dad.
Hi.
You know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, Stanley....  I'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if I don't, I come home without the money....
Mother -- ?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
He was my blood -- and I demand to know what happened to him.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Wh-- Wha--
Tomorrow.
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
Where are you going?!
I offer you the perfect revolution. A revolution without bloodshed, without any loss of life, even without treason, for he too is the son of the King.
I have heard many confessions, d'Artagnan.  But even if I were not a priest, I could tell your heart has a secret weight, and it is hurting you to carry it alone.
Everyone back.
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
It is also a place of burial.
Can we eat... before we go?  This excitement's given me an appetite.
Who does?
None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
She cannot possibly refuse.  Her family is poor, they have even less money than we do.  And along with the invitation, the King sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.
Never mind, Papa, it doesn't matter now.  She loved me once.  I want to die remembering that.
Die?  What...?
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
If the young woman truly loves Raoul --
It is honor you serve, and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor!
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
Recent hours have been a shock.
The old man and woman called me... Phillippe.
That is enough!  You are a good servant, d'Artagnan, but you forget your place!
I want all these passages sealed! Another stupid idea of my father's! Seal them all, every one!
Sire, we have an emergency -- of security.  I must ask you to accompany me.
... The ball... Continue.
Now.  Where is d'Artagnan?
Out directing the search for the traitors.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
We did a little digging on Jim Trudell at Sergeant Zydowski's request. He's 31, no priors, and he's been working for the military for ten years.
We ran the i.d.  I could have told you that.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
Let's roll -
It's kind of a funny coincidence, isn't it?
Just wondering if maybe they had a thing going with this hooker, you know, some connection.
Alright, where is she?
Are you alright?
Did you read today's paper?
Where is he?!!
Captain?
You always carry a gun with you?
I didn't know what to do - but I knew I had something somebody would want.  That's where I met him - told him what I had.  The FBI set me up with a new place...but the cops found me somehow.  So I ran...and met you.
What happened with the tape?
Just what did you get yourself into, Jimmy?
It's...it's a long story.  Can we meet somewhere?
Jesus, man...
No...
I killed them.
I knew I could count on you.
OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
How about Marvosa and the others?
I'm not going anywhere!
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Ditched you?
That was Peterson upstairs.
His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate?
I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in...
And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper?  In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home?  This ends when I make it over.
The main thing is: how was Lecktor to reply.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
How long do I have?
I have to.
He thinks you want him to look at evidence.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What do you want to do?
Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. Five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. Jimmie may in the Finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his Index.
You think I'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?'  That's Ezio Pinza you're thinking about.  The Tooth Fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. He won't stop.
For Christ's sake, why?
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
You got the message Lecktor called...
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
It's not over yet.
You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
No. It's Bob's Photo Store in...
It does, doesn't it?
What?
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
I'll probably go back to it someday.
Reba...
I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over?
No.
Yes.
Do you believe God is in attendance here, Mr. Lounds?
Not me.
Are you a man?
God, no.
You'll let me go now?
Come in.
It's Will Graham...
He's very strong physically.
One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver.
Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
No.
I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
Stay here with me. Me. Me. Me.  And Kevin.  That's selfish, huh?
Molly?
Eating junk food.  They don't have a lock on anything, Molly. There's not enough information. Or I haven't done enough with it...
He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Will? Are you okay?
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
With a knife.  I found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. The kind of shred a pipe threader makes. I was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. It took a long time. In one place there was a resignation letter from a man named Hobbs. I saw it and it was..., peculiar.  I was going up these stairs to Hobbs' apartment. I was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. She was dying.  I sent the officer with me to call a SWAT team. But I could hear kids in there and screaming. I couldn't wait.
You went in the apartment?
Then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
You had disadvantages.
I don't think I'll persuade you. You'll do it or you won't. Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway, and he's the best...
Yes.
Pictures?
Yes. I'd considered it.
I don't have one right now.
I haven't decided yet.
I want to help you, Will. You'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. We don't invent our natures, They're issued to us.  Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. Why fight it?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Tank you veddy much.
People love... comedians.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
George, I hate sitcoms.
We were just trying to push the envelope --
The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks. So I was just giving 'em what they want...
I can't move my arm.
My hair is coming out.
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
But I've got a sports show. Championship wrestling, at five.
Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!!  For all we knew, you were DYING!  Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
Hey, I hope you didn't take that stuff I said seriously.  It was just part of the show!  It's like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
And all this will be for real?
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
How can you be so casual??!
Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks.
Give me the book.
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
I dunno.  If they were, they'd be pushin' 80.
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
It is apparently not working.
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
We had a deal!!
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.
Where?
Sure...
You're two hours late.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Are you sure this line is clean?
Don't tell me you're a believer now?
My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them Morpheus.
Is that...?
I'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  Now don't tell him I told you this, but this ain't the first time Morpheus thought he found the One.
Yes.
Hello?
No way, no way, this is crazy.
It's an honor.
Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
I thought it wasn't real.
Do you understand, Neo?
The beginning?
And she's never wrong.
And you still believe I'm the One?
Did you believe in them too?
Morpheus, the Oracle... she told me --
Tank.
Goddamn!  It's good to hear your voice, sir!
I know a lot about you.  I've been wanting to meet you for some time.
Who is?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
Uh-oh...
What are you doing?
No one has ever done anything like this.
It's a city?
Hey, Mikey, he likes it!  Ready for more?
What are you talking about?
It's locked.
You're not far from Cypher.
That means it's good.
May God be with you.
'Art thou the King of the Jews'?
Kennedy.
Waddaya think?
There won't be any this week.
If you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
I think we should see your uncle.
Look Charlie, you're a good boy. Will you just tell your uncle that I have nothing.  There is nothing to give him.  No envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me?  I think you should be, you know that.
Hey, shut up.
Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore...
What's a'matter?
$500.  He borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
What was it?
Charlie...?
It's still sick.
Well you can't blame them in a way.
The girls like it loud.
Count it.
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
Yeah, it's your father's.
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
Just plain 'Joe'?
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
I hate parties --
I know you do, darling.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Who?
I like it.  I like it.  I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
I thought you were buying my company.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
And what would that be?
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
Hot or cold.
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
'Thoughts'?  Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
Shall we adjourn?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
What have you done?  You've gotten the old man fired!
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
Not time yet.
Only flowers I wan' see's one's over my peaceful self restin' in the dutty.
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
'Joe Black'.  Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
You're an original, Joe.  A little hard to figure, maybe...
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
I'm sorry.  Do you live here?
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
Yes --?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Yes...
No, I'm not.
Girlfriend?
To bed.
Almost.
Yes?
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
More than you love peanut butter?
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.
Will it?
'Love will find out the way'?
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Well, thank you for letting me know.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
It is a deal?
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
How about giving a guy a break?
What's it like where I'm going?
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Glad you like it.  My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches.  Joan -- that was my wife --
And more.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
I don't know.
How about you telling me?  When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer.  That's what I'm used to.  Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
Thanks.
Those were my words, Bill.
And we're very grateful.
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
You're not Death.  You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
I want to have a look around before I take you.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
Fine, fine.  Big doing up here.  Why are you still down here?
We're all here, Bill --
Does Drew tell you everything?
You're only six-five once.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
Nothing.
Where's Joe?
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers.  The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor.  Because I don't want you to examine me.
MEMENTO Pink Revisions - 9/7/99 85.
47.
Well, what then?
Slam it?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
My wife.
What makes you think he's my friend?
Seen you together, that's all.
And he says you're gonna wanna hear what he's got to say.							   *
What?
What the fuck are you doing here?
Do you remember me?
Yeah, I remember you.
Yeah.
Yes.
You know him?
Sounds perfect? What do I owe you?
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Yes.
Did you?
Such as?
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
I told him about your car.
Did you?
Get rid of Dodd for me.
* Depends on if he's here in town. Or if he's moved on. See, I've got all this -			*
Beer, please.
I can't make new memories. Everything			  * fades, nothing sticks. By the time we finish this conversation I won't remember how it started, and the next time I see you I won't know that I've ever met you before.
You've read it a hundred times.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
Shut your mouth!
Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -
We've got to get him out of here.
Shut it, Teddy.
Who the fuck are you?
She has no idea who I am.
Why are you following me?
What sort of questions?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
I was wrong! That's the whole point! Sammy's wife came to me and -
You probably.							 *
Bullshit.							*
No.  I was in Namibia...
About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them.
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
Get me Air Support...  We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...
...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup...  And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya...
Yes you do...
When?
It goes very fast.
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
What do you mean?
Good samba dancing...?
I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front...
Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts?
Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate.
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
Really?
Would you find me...?
Yero, by himself?
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
No.
Hey, fuck him.
What's the point?  It's going down.
Detective Crockett.
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Out of...?
Control your men.
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
Oh, good...
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
Then what were we talking to you for?
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
You want me to stay here tonight, is that the idea?
Well, I hope you know what you're in for. I'm a very dangerous person. Someone does me bad like you. If I caught up with you that night, there'd be one dead Ratso long about now. Hear?
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
Don't need a comb.
These guys're good drivers.
I gotta have more'n ten. I gotta have fifty-seven dollars.
I got a hunch, Joe Buck, it's gonna be easier for you than most.
You're a wonderful boy. You'n me gonna have fun, dammit, it don't have to be joyless. Say, why don't we get right down on our knees now?
Could be ten or fifteen.  Maybe even twenty.
Who?
Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it.
No, I'm not afraid.
Good. Now, where did you get the hashish?
You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
He wasn't even in the car?
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.
But how would you get into the shaft, Jimmy?
Yeah!
What?  You gotta be joking.
Yeah.
I think I've been poisoned.
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash.
Know what?
You know I have lectured at the University of Maryland in your country?  Also University Michigan Very nice country. We both go back. 
There's some weird shit here.
Any luck?
Oh, man, there you go again.
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Do you think we did the right thing?
Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
Thought it was my week for that.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
You give someone a fucking uniform and... Did you hear how he talked to us?
I heard how you talked to him.
Oh, no, you were-
So, you're saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
Ah...
Talk to me.
No...
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
Guess you can tell from my reaction, I'm not all that used to visitors out here. What can I do for you?
I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine, and you could tell me what you think.
Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going.
Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend.
I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted?
Yeah, thanks.
Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly.
No one--she just died--she slipped away, that's all.
No big deal.
I know this is the only copy, Paul. When you were twenty-four you wrote your first book and you didn't make a copy, because you didn't think anybody would take it seriously. But they did. And ever since you've never made any copies because you're superstitious--it's why you always come back to the Silver Creek Lodge. You told that story to Merv Griffin eleven years ago.
You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split.  God knows you're entitled to it.
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
See, isn't this nice?
Annie, what's the matter?
--cliff-hangers--
What?
Well, is it fair? Should I keep going?
Will she still love him with that special perfect love?
I hope you like it.
To Misery.
Paul, I know you've been out.
You've been out of your room.
Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye.
What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm?
Oh, I like that tone.
It's good you found it.
He's your client, huh?
Answer me a couple things?
Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff.  --Lest you call paper odd.
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
I thought you were over it.
I left in a bit of a hurry.  I'm terribly grateful, Sean.
Your room.
Mmmm.
Oh, no, not at all.  Maybe just a bit.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Not at all.  But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site?
And the check's in the mall.
How much longer before you can reach him?
Indeed.
If you weren't going to let me get away with it, why did you let me go thru with it?
Well, then, what I am I doing here?  I assume I'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
What's the population of Seville any idea?
That's lot of people out there..how many of them, I wonder, are capable of something like that?
Can you think of a better one?
Betting table twelve off the paddock. Nyah, are you up to this?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
No.  Should I?
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Not yet.  We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage.
We think we've got our finger on the buyer.
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
You keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, Doctor..
Nekhorvich's boss?
Ethan, I keep telling you there's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up and running!  How much time does she have left?
So what did he say?
It was in the bloody papers, on the telly..what's this about Gradski?
Do I?
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
That's S.O.P..
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..
Is he serious?
Ethan -- Ethan, it's okay.  It's Claire. Ethan what's wrong with you?
I walked away.  He said abort.  He was gone so I walked away.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
We need help, and we don't have time. They have to be local.
It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.
You didn't have to.........
Is this the only way?
Two cars.  Where are you?
Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire.
Claire.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
Yes.
Youíre in Prague?
No sir.
We've lost enough agents for one night.
You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
Who else is left?
Yes.  I see your point.
Correct the actual list is safe at Langley.  "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan.  So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
What are we downloading?
Sure.  They want me back in so I won't break in!  They <i>still</i> can't figure out how we did it.
He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just - not long enough.  Gotta catch my flight.. So.  How's it feel being a solid citizen again?
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
Ah, but, we're asking about you.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
What was your deal with Job?
Done.  Bring it to me in London.  I want it by the end of the week.
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
What about Job?
In position.  Jack open the door, let the package roll.
Ethan.  Heís out of pocket.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Sure.  If the main character does.
Can you lose him?
- and picked us up in the States -
Hey, I showed 'em to you!
What's going on?
Thirty-two and change.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Whatís the problem.
Are you ready?
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
Thank you, Rose.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
Rose, pass the wine.
Again?
Johnny Cammareri.
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
Mona?
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done.
He's in Palermo.
I have no life.
I don't know.
I'm a wolf?
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Son of a bitch!
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Get all of me. Take everything.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'll come to the wedding.
Alright.
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Kinda gaudy.
Awful?
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
What's the matter?
You're making me feel guilty again.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let me go home.
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
I shouldn't.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
On the floor?
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
He's my younger brother.
We should talk alone.
No.
So we'll sell the house.
I'm thirty-seven years old.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
WHAT!! She was dying!
What sins have you to confess?
I know.
He should pay.
Don't fight.
So.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
I think it's because they fear death.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
Look.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
Is who down there?
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Burn them.
Yes!
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Who are the Britons?
NI!   NI!
Of course.
None shall pass.
None shall pass.
Well, what are you then?
Well now, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall and then leap out of the rabbit and take the French by surprise, not only by surprise but totally unarmed!
Who ... Who breaks out?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Oh, shut up.
I didn't know you were called Dennis.
I've said I'm sorry about the old woman, but from the behind you looked ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
Yes, I see.
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
Bloody peasant! 
Sorry ...
Make a bridge out of her.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
To find the Holy Grail.
Thanks very much.
I can explain ...  I was in the forest ... riding north from Camelot ... when I got this note.
One day, lad, all this will be yours ...
Rather what?
Hurry, brave Sir Launcelot!
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
Yes ...  make sure ...
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Er ... Sir Galahad... the Chaste.
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
Look, let me go back in there and face the peril?
No.  It's unhealthy.
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Er, That's ... That's enough music for a while, lads. It Looks as though like there's dirty work afoot.
He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who ...
No, no, no.
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
The good-looking one.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
I've got my duties to attend to.
Good man.  And is she all right?
Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am.
Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here.
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
It's the Queen's decision.
She's busy.
Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive?
We --
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries.  No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Do you?
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
No.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear.  You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
That can wait till the weekend.
Do you hunt?
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God.  You must miss such magnificent views.
It's nothing.
For Her Majesty.
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
They don't see it.
They aren't as watchful as you.
The greasy pole.
In time, she will.
She'll think I betrayed her.
Mr Brown.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
We took a nip of whiskey.
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
Have I ever let you down before--?
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
I came as quickly as I could.
Is that not enough?
Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk.  Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
You can't know that for sure.
We think she can be dissuaded.  Have you had a glance at the diary?
What is he doing there?
Mr Brown is unable to attend today.
I believe he is unwell, ma'am.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
Read it.
I have no idea.
What's the riddle?
Hmmm.  He said you were going to have dinner?
See, men always do this.  "Quiet down, honey.  Chill out.  Take a Valium". I'm not a fucking idiot, Nick!  I DID NOT IMAGINE IT!!!
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
I've been thinking about that.  ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin?
Yes I am...
And what if something happens to you? Am I suppose to go in after you alone?!
Okay.  Give us a kiss?
One.  In case...
Which way do you think Level Two is?
Go for it.
Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think!
"Escape"?
So what do you think?
So start at the beginning...
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
I'm going home Cynthia.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
We'd be happy to put her in the pile for considerations ... you'd be pleased to know there's quite a lot of interest in this role.
You're an understandin' fella.
... What??
Well, I ...
I guess I've come to quite a place.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
My name is Rita.
What?
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
Yes, there was.
No...I need to sleep.
What do you mean?
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
No... but...
I don't think...
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
This Denny's.
Go ahead.
To get rid of this god-awful feeling.
Could be unrelated.
Find out who they are?
No...
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
Good morning. What do you have today ?
Where are we ?
Why should we trust you ?
Why should I ?
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
Why did you build this whole place ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
He hired you to build this place ?
There's more to it than trying to see if you'd steal from the company or if you'd lie or cheat.
What do you mean ?
Well, I'll see you at the next staff party.
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
That's not to tough.
Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
I made my bones on the street, you know. I did Riglioni in his own house. I was made in the Family, okay.
You did.
I see here that this guy has made deposits into his own account for the last four months. Each one in the amount of $100,000. He then puts in deposits into his girlfriends account.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Sir, I came from the Chicago offices myself, and if I may say, sir, there are still some very good....
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
Relax, son. They'll learn in time that you don't fuck with First Bank. This is the real deal and we aim to keep it strong. My Daddy always told me that Only The Strong Survive.
Yes sir, I do. Last night's, fresh from the Park.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
Sir ?
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
No. I am not a homosexual.
Then what do you want ?
What is Bruce doing ?
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
How's your foot ?
It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
Hey good lookin' ! What'cha got cookin' ?
We start with the top and work our way down. We start with the high salaries and then just let the little people go. No need to make the blue collars go crazy.
Look, Miss. I know you're still upset about that incident in Chicago, but understand, this is a cut throat business. We don't have time to play nursemaid to every single Tom Dick and Harry.
You had to remind me?
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
I don't think you're very polite.
I thought I told you to lose this guy.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
Seriously?
So you're saying...What are you saying??
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Hi honey.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
Oh.  Ohhh?
Sure am, who are you?
You are?
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
Well...
oh.
Come on in!
What's the matter?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
Thanks
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
Care for a smoke?
You would.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
In the tar??
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
Hey look!
Good. I mean...
It's not his fault!
Well Rose was being very thorough.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
I should do this myself.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
You're Nick's mother?
Well maybe for you.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I think it's still available.
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
I wrote that.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
What's that?
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
Home sweet home.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
What happened to her?
This is where we are.
Do you want to?
Goodnight Shelly.
Did you ahh, love him?
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
She likes to play bingo.
Can I go too?
Yes..
Why not?
Are you sure about all this?
Hi.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
This is one big house for one single person.
How much does it cost?
I paid the money.
We'd love to hear it.
So you fill it with water like this, and what have you got? A water gun.
Shut your big fat mouth!
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
I would.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Can I use your bathroom first?
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
NO!
I'm hemorrhaging.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
It's a mosquito bite.
It'll bleed.
Where's your bike?
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
Sorry.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Bed wetter!
You're right, let's knock it down.
Run faster they're after us!!
Hi Vada.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
Come on, let's go.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Uh huh.
No.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Just do it.
Okay, okay.
Say something it's too quiet.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
I should look different.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
Ben Gay.
Two words.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
Exactly what?
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
What happened?
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
Michael...
Look, I came down here to face everybody.  I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
I asked you...
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting.  Lost.  Alone.  Like her life is over.
Because I could come...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Well, if that's the way you f...
Nose tackle from the Bears... power forward from the Bulls... defenseman from the Black Hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
I won first prize.
Is there food?
No.
What's wrong with her.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Well, I just thought I'd call.
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
They can come to the concert in the park.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Well, how about the shopping center?
D.C.
Howdy.
Yes, sir. I need a room
How do you know?
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
No.
Parts.
Do you carry door handles?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Bet the sheets are grey.
No. No, they're white. He's got a nice dog.
I want to get the dog off my bed.
Have your children been deaf since birth?
How long have you been with them?
About three years.
Hello.
I don't know who you are.
Wow!
I have to go. He sighs.
I can't.
When did you think it would happen?
That's unkind.
I'm forty-six. Do you like to go up or down?
Hello. John Triplette.
We just got a gold record.
How long have you been together?
Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Come on.
Hi.
Why?
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
It's not bad.
If you're serious. Being serious is real important.
I see.
Which do you recommend?
Haven't you been listening to a fuckin' word I said? ...Oh, I'm sorry. Can I say fuckin'? I can't, can I?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
You been followin' the news coverage?
Look, our situation in a nutshell is, no prison wants 'em, no prison will take 'em. I'm even talkin' hellholes, where the warden's as hard as a bar of iron. No one wants those fuckin' assholes behind their walls, dealin' with 'em day in, day out.
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
How come you never talk?
How is it?
Do you have a back up.
Whose ratings were higher?
Manson beat you.
Sorry about that.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Sure.
Yeah, we have a van.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
I admire them.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Take a wild stab!
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon/Frost interviews...
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
How 'bout Mallory?
Would the network really not run it without the interview?
Rollin'...and speed!
It's gonna be beautiful.
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Want me to come?
Okay.
Uh-huh. Well, this ain't the railroad. Now what's all this talk about stickin' together?
Look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and I aim to keep it that way. Now I got an idea you're plannin' trouble.
What did you say your name is?
Well, she never gave me none. Look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
I don't know. He's your boy.
Name's Duff.
You know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
Okay.
Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
You must be new in town.
No. I'm new in town.
You working?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
I like a place with lots of life.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
That's the way he is.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah. Well, I do.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
That's right.
Okay, I guess.
What's wrong?
Uh-huh. Why?
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
We was just leavin', fellows.
They all got families to support.
'See ya.
Plannin' on getting married?
'Don't sound so sure.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
Want me to hold the light for you?
Whenever he's got an edge on.
How often is that?
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
Who is?!
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
I guess not.
Man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? You won't get no place.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
Your Raoul?
I want my wife.  I told you and told you. Now I'm gettin' tired of this shit--
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
How long's it been?
It's nothing. C'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
What about her?
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
I'll think you'll find everything in working order. Molly's just having a little fun.
I don't call this fun, pal. You're playing God with my body.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
You ran without us.
What are you talking about?
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Then I'm out. I don't give a shit about you or this run.
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
What elders?
Case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
Ready?
Don't know, mon. This is a jumpship. Not meant for transport.
Right...
Can you take me to it?
What?
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
You set me up from the beginning. It was you that got Julius killed.
And Linda...
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Why should I want to meet him.
He's a resourceful guy, your boss. How long you work for him?
Holy shit...
You're not ready yet. They said two days.
I'll get the car.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
...And if I guess wrong?
Thanks.
College?
What's that?
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
Yes, it's lame.
No Roger from op/ed?
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
Senorita Josie.
Cuuuute!
Wings?
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Don't tell me... You're Medieval Barbie.
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
God, I can't do this.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
What!?
Do you remember high school?
I know. I came up with it.  You look nauseous.
You like her?
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Why do you do that?
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Do you think you'll find her?
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Why?
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
He sure is big, Jack...
I know.
I'm not hungry.  What's wrong?  I spent all morning on that soup.  I thought you liked Worm's Wart.
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
Oh, come on Dad...
I'm not afraid of you.  You couldn't kill me...He's in there and I want him back.  I'm gonna take him away from you and you're going straight back to hell, you son-of-a-bitch!
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
Are you nuts or something?
your timing was perfect - I was getting the third degree in there.
How come?
I figured you might like some help.
"March 7th - Glen asked me to sleep with him again.  I can't yet - I like him, I want to make him happy but I'm not sure that I love him. I can't sleep with someone I don't love."
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
About not finding any bogey men?
Who, Jesse?
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen acting different? Did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
Just some answers.  There are other kids involved, its not just Kristen.  All good kids, smark kids.
They're healing up nicely.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
I used to live in this house.
You like gymnastics?
Joey needs us.  I can feel him.
Kristen, can you pull us out?
He's gone.  It's over.  Please don't die, Nancy.  Please.
Can't be good news coming from you.
The dispensary.  I'm talking clean pharmaceutical high.  A night at Club meth.
I just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
I've had some experience with pattern nightmares.
So I've been told.  Practically an obsession of your.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
Just until we get things under control.
I can't believe I just did that.
Doesn't matter.
You sound like Peter Pan.
Nancy...
What?
I know what it is.  I just can't believe what I'm hearing.  What has she talked you into?
Hi.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
No.
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
Busy tomorrow?
What did you say?
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
She saw through me.
No, you were brilliant
No, that's fine.  It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star.  It was a thrill for me.  How is he?
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You've got big feet.
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Well...
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Can I stay a bit longer?
How are you doing?
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
That's right.
In a depressingly asexual way.
Well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... isn't it...
Working with Leonardo.
Hi guys.  Oh holy fuck.
What do you think?  Good move?
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me.
Shall I go get a cappuccino?  Ease the pain.
Right -- want another one?
Let's face facts.  This was always a no-go situation.  Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Buggered?
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
May I help you, sir?
Can I help you?
I'm afraid I can't really let you through then, sir.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff.
What did she say?
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses?
Yes.
And you get on very well.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
The one down your trousers.
No, Miss Ratched...
Why?
Tell us about it...
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
Yeah?
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
Yeah, it'll satisfy me.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
I hope everything is settled.
B-B-Billy.
What I wanna know is who's the top loony around here?
So long suckers.
Candy? Hell no, Billy, she's just a good friend, that's all...
Ahhh, Billy...
Ca-na-da...
Wait a minute...
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
They must be up there!
There they are!
Martini!
A pecking party?
What's your plan, Mack?
Why not?
Hear what?
Can you borrow me a dime?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Gary Blinker's fulla shit!
Oh, what's that?
Hell, Doc, I've been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the Northwest till the Army taught me what my natural bent was.
No, this is my first trip, Doc.
You bet, Doc!
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Are you a doctor?
What's troubling ya, buddy?
Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
How much ya wanna bet?
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
You know, I never got your name.
Okay, Mack!  Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Yeah!
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.
Evenin', ma'am.
That!
I thought so.
Is he in an asylum?
He is your husband, no?
So, what's the story with your friend?
I don't get it.  She hasn't seen her since she was a kid, now just because she's dying, all of the sudden she's gotta see her again?
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
I'm a liberal!
Ask her if she knows where he is?
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
Smoking or non-smoking?
Hm.
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
I'm in love with you.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?...  Just tell me what it is, I'll say it.  I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
Oh.  That's nice.
What are you doing here?
So were you.
Hi.
I know the feeling.
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Just since yesterday.
Wait.
No.  He smokes.
Is he married?
So?...
You don't have any idea?
Kate, is something the matter?
No...  I can just tell.
You don't have a passport.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
I just got a dial tone--
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
A phone message.  Only--
Only what?
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
Her brother.
What did you say to her?
Sure you did.
Faith--
And then what, Faith?
Like a detective.
It was a ouija board, remember?
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
Uh huh.
And Larry?...
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
You think I'm just one of those Italian Casanovas.  The guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  Who prey on unhappily married women.  Who lure unsuspecting--
No, why?
Damon Bradley?  That's why you're here?
It was just a joke.  I was pushing the arrow.  I wanted to get to the next question.  I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
And don't be walking off with any of that. You know how the boss feels about individual pilferage.
You mean to sit there and tell me that your local takes in sixty-five thousand, five hundred dollars every year and keeps no financial records?
Well, where are they?
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
I'm with Terry.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
I can get home all right from here
What for?
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Wham... .
How do you like it?
How about another one?
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Terry!
What are you crying for?
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?
I don't rate it.
Edie I I never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you you're... .
Terry, what's wrong?
I've been sittin' in the church.
Who says?
Terry what's happening to you?
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
I know what you want me to do!
Edie.
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
Who is he, Pop?
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Now don't give me a hard time.
Your gun.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Down to the wire?
Waterfront Crime Commission ?  What's that?
Really?
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
You'll work.
Looking for me?
Do you?
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung!  You should have  You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
You want to know somethin'?
You ratted on us, Terry.
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Definitely! Nolan, my boy, you're a walkin' distillery.
Keep Charley out of this.
Leave her alone, I tell you!
Something's making that music.
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
Don't let them hear you.
What can we do?
Easy Shirley, Easy!  Panic won't do us any good!  Let me think. We've got to stall for time.
Be careful!
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
You do?
There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
But they are not yet one of us.
At the first sight of the morning's rays' light...
I understand, Master
Then see that it does not happen again, in the penalty of Everlasting Despair.  Now are there others?
Live ones where only the dead should be?
Did you do something to get us into trouble again?
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now.  So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Glenn Michaels.
Yes.
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
He didn't want me to.
Till they got busted.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
How long you talk to her?
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell.  That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up.  Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
You find out?
And then they'll kill 'em.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm going back inside.
In the trunk, yeah?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Daniel.  Listen --
All right, but...
Sure, Daniel.
That's all I wanted to know.
Yeah, why?
I told you, man, Super Bowl Sunday.
Ironic, isn't it?
Quite a mess.
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand?  How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
We still talk, though.
Is that right?
You're sure easy to talk to.  I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Well, we got that out of the way.  Tell me, Celeste.  What do you do for a living?
You did?
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
I don't think it works if we're somebody else.  You know what I mean?  Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
Well, does it make sense to you?
I called your room from downstairs.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
She did, huh.
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
I don't think we should get into that.
You coming back?
Pretend I'm somebody else.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check.  Like that, fifty mil, signed his name.  Whoa-- little help here!
You think he's lying?
Weren't you expecting us?
What happened to your shades?  Someone finally step on 'em?
When?
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here?  What's going on?  Who's upstairs?
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
Islamic.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
The <u>ninth</u>?
Do we have a gun in the car?
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Gee, I wonder why not.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced.  Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife?  That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
He doesn't even look like that.
He waved to you?
So?
I told you, he isn't here.
Out for the evening?
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa.  She says he was very gentle.
He, I'm R-Red.  Red S-Strange.
Do you always stutter?
Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
What lizard?
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Land of the free...
Waitress!  Four beers!
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
They're all over us!
I got a half a tank.  You?
I can't make it.
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
We won't have the fuel to get back to the carriers; they'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we're airborne.
No baseball diamonds, Red.
Win?
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
Uncharged torpedoes have different balance.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese.
You have something to say, Yamamoto?
Well, I like to speculate. This book I'm reading right now, a woman in Colorado says she lived in Ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. Her name was Bridey Murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. She was hypnotized. Big bestseller.
Where were you? You said you'd be back at twelve.
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I'll call you Later.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
Maybe I blocked it out.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
Is this slow enough for you?
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
But what has to be different?
I love you.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
I'll never give up.
What would that be, sir?
Did you study for the test?
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author  fat, violent, drunk...
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Is that one of your poems?
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Oh, you're both so naive.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
How do you feel?
When did you start drinking coffee?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What happened to you?
I had a dream that Grandma died.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
You look exactly the same.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that.  You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I	know what a burrito is.
Am I dead or not?
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Like what?
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
I couldn't help it  I loved him.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
Why are you bothering me about this? Can't you leave it be?
Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead.
What?
Yes... why?
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
Your momma's worried sick over you. You take off in the middle of the night, you don't show up for school. What're you trying to prove?
I've never seen anybody punch Clyde before.
How did it go with your father last night?
I know, Mom.
Mom...
Yes!
This time. What about next time?
Perhaps... you're right. I've certainly been busy. With the Kronos complaint, a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time...
What's that mean?!
Then, what <u>are</u> we, Drew?! The <u>winners</u>? "Ladies and gentlemen, the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his lover Miguel..." Excuse me, I'm not your lover. I'm your Care Partner. FUCK!
I know that, Charles.
I hoped the challenge would improve your performance. You could say it was a carrot.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
New baby?
I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine?
I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it.
Look. I know I have a case. If you don't want to take it for personal reasons...
What?
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
We proceed, representing your estate.
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I'll look over the Q and A.
What kind of person is that?
Thanks for coming by.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
No.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
Objection!
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.
Do I look gay to you? Relax.
Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
Lots.
Since when?
I'll see you in an hour, max.
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
<u>She</u> didn't try to conceal it.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
Let's continue.
Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic.
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
Charles...
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping them out. Quick hits only -- try to make it last.
'Mean the whispers?
You did this? To yourself?
Why, what'd you hear?
Riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually --
But I just wanted to say --
Been a long time since anyone's trusted me. That's somethin' right there.
We're just here to carry your light, aren't we? Just the torch-bearers.
So where the hell's God now, huh?  I'll tell you where! He's up there PISSING ON ME!
<u>I trusted you</u>, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
Just come with me!
I can't....I can't....
But they...they could still be....
How many bottles?
Be my choice. Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
He used that?
I <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories on --
And here you got two mornings every day. Wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
Why did I fall on you?
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
Some prophet guy?
And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
What're you doin'?
King Tut's tomb....
So just like that. Wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
She's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Ain't all of us gonna make it.
So much for your nightfall.
I ask you to reconsider the rash course you've taken. If you're convicted of heresy, the most you'll get is two years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you'll hang for high treason.
Your conclusion is premature. Have you forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll?  'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the children made sport of him.'
Seal the cave?
Taylor, I'd rather you -
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
How did it go?
Which direction?
That way.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
Good morning, Julius. How's our patient today?
You don't seem very cut up about it.
If only we could get a fix.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
He wouldn't leave her.
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
Dr. Zira -- tell Bright Eyes to sit down.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
One is in a museum!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
Sustained.
Because you're not unique. There was the one you call Landon --
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Stop right there.
What is your proposal?
Then answer this: If ran was superior, why didn't he survive?
Sure.	In a cage.
Where have you been? Why didn't you come to see me?
Why not?
I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.
Do you believe him?
He doesn't know.
But there's the doll, sir.
How the hell did he get away?
You're dead, you're fucking dead Elias!
Where the fuck is red platoon! Tell 'em to get their asses up here! What the fuck you doin' back here Elias? Round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
Says he can't walk.
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Does he have a metal plate in his head?
Yo getting there Taylor. You be cool now and I'll introduce you 'round to some of the 'heads'.
What are the heads?
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
Not the only man to meet his Jezebel either.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
Begging your pardon Lieutenant but my holes are far enuff apart you could run a regiment through there and nobody'd see them - I got five live bodies left...
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
How long would that take?
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
No, please.
No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But..  If you really want a good dry Martini..
You're drinking it.
Would it make you anymore amusing?
Nice of him.
He knew the immigration officer. He eased himself in.
Want a spike in it?
Bad?
Is this the best you can do?
Why not?
I didn't notice him.
I hated to go to that place.  I almost went to the police station instead.
They're going to arrest me.
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
And Betty Mayfield--
This must have cost a fortune.
I'd still go through--even if I ended up in jail.
I decided I didn't want a drink...I'm beginning to wonder.
Funny, I never thought of you that way.  You were so close too.  We were all pretty stupid about you.
You-killed-him?
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
Yes, Miss.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Mrs. West is a very emotional woman.
An unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
Good morning, Mr. Killaine. I'm sorry I can't give you the name of my bank--because I have no bank at the moment.  That was a crude trick.
Care for a stroll outside? Beautiful morning. The air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
FLorida?
But not in the investigation of a major crime, I hope.
I expected nothing else.
So Mitchell had handled it. Afterwards, Brandon picked it up.  There's no indication you handled it.
I know that.
Name it.
What are your rates?
Bluff. You've waited too long.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
Leave that one lay.
Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
She doesn't look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
How about a cup of coffee?
In case you want to have us followed.
I have a warrant for her arrest.
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
How would you know, Brandon?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
What do you want?
I'm a very observant man. You had something in your bag this afternoon, Something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. Something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. You went out with Mitchell. None of us ever saw him again.
Nastiness. You're nasty with words. Why wouldn't you be nasty with deeds once in a while? You hated him--and I know why.
Recently, then.
You're the waterfront specialist. Find out about it.  I've got a murder to investigate.
Send that?
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
What's the face for, Driscoll?
"G.G. Market one-eight-four-two."
Gigi, huh?  Sounds French--one of those fancy ladies.  Must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
Was that about the right angle?
Do I know that she's out of the room?  Likely to be out of it for some time?
This is the shell.  What about the gun?
Greer and Goble in the Call Building, San Francisco.  Just like you thought...Two murders in two days.  Different places, different methods, different people. Nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
Oh, the Coldstream Guards.  Don't you take your hat off in elevators?
Other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they're willing to tell us.
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
I am a fool.
Did you ever have a serious operation?
Sure.  You didn't come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  You wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about Mitchell.  If I believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
He checks too.
Am I to interpret that as an order to arrest Miss Mayfield?
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
Well, find out.  Who's covering her?
This girl is a murderess, Killaine.
"Superintendent J. Mckechnie, Vancouver Police Department. Vancouver B.c. Replaying To Your E.P. teletype classification No. 2684 incomplete.  We advise identification possible.  Elizabeth Kinsolving, arrested Greenwater, North Carolina, January 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  Signed, FBI., Washington, D.C. H. Cleary, Inspector in charge."  Have ye any comment, Killaine?
But you still think she's innocent.
She's just a girl I met on the train. You don't mind do you?
I have a rough idea.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
You already have the checks, darling.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
It's kind of you to see me.
He's a little unhappy.  I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Shall we go?
What went wrong?
But what we need is national coverage.  It's difficult with this Falklands madness going on. Do you think you might be able to do something when you get back?
I'm not sure I can face it.
How's Mary?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
I'll have some of that.
Are you going to have coffee?
Freshman and sophomores...
It's everything we wanted.  A very good read.  A terrific piece of work.  So, here's to you and Suez.
Can I give you a lift?
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
I think she liked me.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?
Might?
Blasé and epicene.
Bastard.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.
You approve!
Let me see.
Hold those rights.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
Perhaps I will, then.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
I'm waiting for your mother.
She's not my mother, anyway.  My mother's in Italy.
Suez.  1956.
All right.
Fifteen news items.  I got exactly the same running order as the bulletin desk.  They're all old pros.
Hello, Jimmy.
Now, are you going to have some more tea?
Then one of them was sick all over your new dress.
Ah, Susy, it...
No.
Once.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
Wild ride, huh?
Yeah?  What?
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?
Special Agent Utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. Yes, the surfboard bothers me.  Yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  And yes, you bother me.  You two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the Ex- Presidents have robbed two more banks!!  Do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Smart.  You burn time in the vault.
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
I say we call it in.  Get some backup.  But you gotta do it.  Harp won't listen to me.
Shrimp and fries.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
I... I gotta go.
Who cares!
Bye.
Like the old days, Dillon.
Wasn't my style. We're a rescue unit, not assassins.  This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important?
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
What are you talking about? We'll be out of here in ten minutes.
This isn't your style, Dillon.
Hawkins?
Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing.  Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
Storage, I think.
Congratulations, sir.
You've got a lot of nerve.
No.  What I have is a lot of money.
Of course, yes.  After the <u>expected</u> filing period is over, I'm going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Sure.  For five bucks.
New York.
<u>Ho</u>tel.
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
You're joking.
What's your name, lover.
Off the boulevard.
Room service.  What do you drink?
Diet coke.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
Assets are anything of value a company owns.  Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  By selling them off, I make a profit.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
Of course.  How much?
Done.
Never answer the phone.  Ever.
Did you buy some clothes?
And that's the way the game is played.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
Was someone rude to you?
You always been rich?
He's good at what he does.
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
You won't.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
You're packing.
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Yes...
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Give me twenty minutes.
I don't think there's any sense in --
And I don't like what we've become.  I'll cover any losses you have on this one.  Now get out, you asshole!
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
'Lo.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Who did you think?
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Want a pair of boots?
Yeah, what?
Kit give me nothin'.
I also place las chocolates on the pillow.
You're a guest here?
I like steak.
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
Hi, Barney!
What?
Till they kill you. Yeah.
I killed him myself.
Who are you?
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
We did it.
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
Who's Guilder?
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
Hello.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
Inigo.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Oh no. No, please.
You read that wrong. She doesn't marry Humperdinck, she marries Westley. I'm just sure of it. After all that Westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it wouldn't be fair.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
Okay.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Sir. Sir.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
You are wonderful!
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
Don't say another word, Valerie.
What, Humperdinck? Humperdinck. Humperdinck. Ooo-ooo, Humperdinck
I'm not listening.
Guess what.
I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, Roger.  Up to now, you've always been associated with musicals, and...
Congratulations.
"By the light, by the light,
"Of the silvery mooooon,
"He wants to croon, he wants to croon,
"Honeymoon,
How do you do.  I mean ... Excuse me ... I mean ...
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
All right.  Get a hold of yourself. Take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ...
Well, sir, it seems ...
Here, don't panic.
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Let me see ... it's such a beautiful day.  Why waste it indoors.  I've got it!  Let's go to Coney Island! We'll lunch at the sea shore.
What kind now, Leo?
There it is... in red and white! "Springtime For Hitler," signed, sealed and delivered.  What's the matter with you?
They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
Do you think he'll take the job?
Here comes the Times Drama Critic.
No way out.  No way out.
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
I vas never a member of the Nazi party.  I am not responsible.  I only followed orders.  Who are you?
We loved it.  We thought it was a masterpiece.  That's why we're here. We want to produce it on Broadway.
Not.
No.  No Motel.  Get car.  Get car.
Feeling better?
The Graf Spee...
Heil you know who!
Who can we attack?  They're all too big.
No. No one has stopped here in weeks...
No. At least I don't recall.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
No.
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
Back where?
Oh. My private parlor. She had an awful hunger... so I made her some supper. And then she went to bed and left in the morning. I didn't even see her leave.
I guess I've got one of those faces you can't help believing.
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
You came up here on a hunch, Miss Crane? Nothing more? No phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
How much?
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Five hundred.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Here?
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
And you thought she'd come up here, to me? If she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
What thing could we be in together?
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
I ought to call the police right now!
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
She haven't even called you?
Where... can I stay?
Where'd you go to college?
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Why not?
The only girlish thing you have lost.
And after the steak... do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama's picture to the wall?
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
I'm thinking of it.
Don't miss your plane.
Stuffy in here.  Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with "Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there.... 
There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
Then will you do me a favor?  Will you have supper here?  I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
You'd know, of course.
Uncommon, too.
It's more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
Oh, no!  I run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows I might be capable of doing.
You go out... with friends?
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Phoenix?
I'd like to, but...
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
Is there what?  I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
We have a problem.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Barefaced.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
Did you wish to see someone?
No, not exactly. Why the great anxiety? It must be something important.
He's inherited a fortune.
Sure--they're sorta queer, I'd say. They's lots of queer goings on up there. They even brought a dog back to life once.
But where do the rats come in?
Oh, yes, he's in good hands now.
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
What's down there?
You can't double-cross me like that.  You were to help me. You were to operate on him. You were going to put him under my power.
The child!
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
What are you laughing at?
I don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
You would.
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.
That's the way I feel about it.
Although you would be amused if I were to tell you that I knew you before you were born. Before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... I made a very beautiful statue. Even if I had not met with this disaster, I could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. And, my child, you are that figure come to life. I wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
But it was really my fault.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
The body of Joan Gale!
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
All right, what about it? We get out a paper just the same. Did you ever stop to think of that?
You give me a pain!
And they never proved anything against him.
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Great! ... If he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. Come on -- beat it. It's five o'clock. You need some sleep.
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
Well, why so mysterious! Come on, spill it.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
Mit me, kid. I've got a classic.
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
Was there any art on Judge Ramsey?
I don't remember. Not so very far--
Fine. You're the first reporter in here for two hours. You people seeing the old year out?
It's all yours.
Where'd you get the stag hound?
He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
Cry-baby?
That happens to be the truth.
No, really -- I'm crazy about you.
That doesn't seem so bad to me. What is wrong with it?
Yep. Everything settled.
To isolation.  To an armed camp.  To a biblical spoof of a crazed father firing a gun at his only son.
Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me  to this particular switching station?
Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss?
What was her name?
I'm heading out of town.
That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment.
Dysfunctional --
But who were they?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
'Course it does.
Well, some fiend might.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Five hundred rabbits?
You were up late last night, Brother.
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble --  Brother, you ought to hear this.
I think Daddy suspects.
There goes Mother.
This is my place and you can't have it.
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average.
About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son.  Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you?
Got another twenty years in it, boy.  By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion.
The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac.
No, son, she is dead.
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
Go ahead, Doctor, I think I am following you.
First, about the girl's history. Evidently she's been very promiscuous since early childhood, she has no control over her sexual impulses. Furthermore, she is permanently barren, she can't have children.
Of course.
Turn up your hearing aid.
What?
Um-hmm. Almost too perfect.
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
She will succeed.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality.  Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
I am not being brutal to her!
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Darlin', Rose has got to go!
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Reluctantly, I do. It would be a blessing to her and everyone else. The girl is oversexed and I say -- spay her!
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Is anything wrong?
If you've got time before you go "out," get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup.
Yes, sir.
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see...
Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it.  There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me.  Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side.
Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town.
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
Dave, you are as full of shit as a Christmas turkey and you know it. Now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. But I am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.
Yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find Mr. Right, but she did it. She found him.
Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you?
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
You can stop it right now.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
I figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
And... ?
Now you know what to watch for...
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
It's six o'clock.  Time's runaing out.  Decide.
It's bone dry out there.  Everybody's hurting.  The stuff floating around's been cut so many times it's like powdered sugar, but Zimnermann's gonna fix it.
How's your precious little school-marm today?
Escort everyone's favorite She-Male over here nice and peaceful-like. Let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I'll never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
Sons of bitches!
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Ah, jeez, Billy... careful!
Yeah.
Dean Martin.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
What about him?
They shot us all, kid.
Well, I would like to sit in front today.
Birth control's important.
Bullshit.
Let's go!  Fuck everything!  God damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I'm gonna rip'em all brand new assholes... !
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
No.
Maybe.
Well, sir...
I... I think I can... clarify...
Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
You bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you're in it.  And for what, Kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? Tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
It's our job.
You know what I mean.
"Go, go, go!"  "Slow down."  Make up your mind.
Get closer!  Don't lose him!
What... ?  Not you too?
Why the beach?
Know what I love about dynamite?
I don't think so.
This shit was Ming.
I can't kill my own father.
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.
Where am I?
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
I have felt him, my Master.
Luke!
Fine. Together again, huh?
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?
Someone who loves you.
I'm sorry.
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.
Good luck.
What are you telling them?
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.
There it is!
He's my father.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
If that is your destiny.
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
Well, I'm sorry.
Janet!
And Ralph himself will be in line for promotion in a year or so.
What was that bang?
No, don't do that.
Hello.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
Promise you won't tell Brad.
Was all I had to say
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
I think you had better both come inside.
Creature of the night.
...How's the turtle food this week?
It's Thanksgiving.
...Aren't you skating?
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
Some people are very shy by nature.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Yes, I do.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
It's not that --
It's all right -- You're my guest.
They're all the same.
I should leave.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Don't you open them anymore?
Like?
Sharp -- Real nice.
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
What're we going to do?
Paulie!
...Paulie. Stop now!
Too old, dull fighter.  Bobby Judge is a good boy.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
You could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means Champion Apollo Creed is heading towards the ring --
Yo' know I iz the best man here! Yo' said so yoself!
Don't hit the face! Not the face!!
A hundred an' thirty.
...The juice is climbin' every week.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Ya sure?
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
Mr. Balboa --
Sparrin'?
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
Did you hear what I said?
Hey --
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
...Did ya fight last night?
Did ya win?
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
'Bout an hour ago.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
...Sure.
I'll do okay.
I got whiskey here.
You ballin' her?
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
And now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Any comment?
Yeah, I had to go slummin'.  See, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
Big on the musical comedy, huh?
What's this, Roger?
You'll have it in the morning.  Now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
I just stopped by to tell you that I checked out the Acme probate.
Nope.  It's that Cloverleaf outfit again.
What've I got to lose?  You okay, Dolores?
That'll work out just fine.  When this thing is over, I'll take you to Catalina.  How does that sound?
Marvin Acme had no will.  I should know, the probate is in my court.
These roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal Toon vehicle.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
Tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a Toon named Roger the Rabbit.
How much do you know about show business, Valiant?
You're not too good at this, are you, R.K.?
You tricked me, damn you!
Oh, yeah?  Then how'd you find my house?
Hey!  What do you think you're doin'?
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
If you do, sir, I am for you.  I serve as good a man as you.
Romeo! Romeo!
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, &quot;God send me no need of thee.&quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Of love?
Farewell, my cuz.
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Uncle, this is that villain Romeo, a Montague, our foe.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
O, she new well. Thy love read by rote and could not spell. Come, young waverer, come, go with me, In one respect I'll thy assistant be; for this alliance may so happy prove, to turn you household rachor to pure love.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
Goodnight.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
What?
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
Why, may one ask?
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Pink for flower.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
I will follow you.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
Well I don't!
So where do you go from here?
Who the fuck are you?
What is?
Lose them!
You better be careful, Seamus, before something happens a plastic surgeon can't fix.
I still am.
From here on in you want something you pay cash for it: no credit cards, no bank accounts are in place: ten percent up front, the rest when the job is done.  You.  What do you do and what should we call you?
But would you stake your life, that's the question...
Now then, let's run through it one more time, shall we?  What's your job?
Yes, Gregor, they sent me.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
We'll double your price.
So, you've got it all figured, do you?
I swear...
Sent it where?
Of course.  Don't you?
Not exactly?  But close enough, eh?  So he saved your life, then?
Yeah.
I didn't expect that he would.
You suffered through an agonizing pain last night, pain you could have avoided by declaring yourself an agent of the law.
So this is what, a test?
You seem one to me.
You shoot alright.
I'm just worried about your health, Larry.  You could stand to shed a few pounds.
Eat shit and die slowly...
Of course...whenever you feel like it just help yourself.
A lot of people died.
This doesn't involve you, don't you understand?  I can't even guarantee you any money out of all this.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
It's my job.
Very ugly.
I was waiting to see what would happen. I didn't want to kill him if I didn't have to.
They don't have the package.
Not just like that... Just before I turn around and it's six months from now and the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is light a cigarette.
Closest and oldest.
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I know.
Gone.  Destroyed.
I told you, I quit.
Cause the Russian production company would be easier to find.
Do you have the tape?
What the hell happened here?
Damn.
Shut up!  Not another word out of you!  You're going down, the Feds know all about it!  You didn't know some of it was marked, did you! Where's the rest?
I would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
Seven thousand...
Robbed a bank, c'mon!  Don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit I don't know how many were at large!  Don't you think there would be a bulletin?  This is a big ass drug deal!
I'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
How long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? Answer me!
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Come on. Booth grabs the bag --
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
Just one more.  This one knocks off all the rest.
Why don't you get to the point.
Besides, I'm not stupid, Earl. The tape was a basic Maxell D-80.  You can buy 'em at any store.  There's no way they can pin anything on me.
Well, I don't know...
How much?
None of us like it!
Come on, Booth.  Don't let him do this!!!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
Hi.
Nothing's wrong.
How the hell did he find it?
Let's hope so. SALLY If he asks me again, I'm gonna tell him I returned it all.
Why?
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Uh, no...
Why would someone do that?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
We don't know.  Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
Have you known this all along?
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Yeah.
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
Anything I can help you with?
No, I can't say that I have.
C?
Well...I should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
Damn its hot in here...
Aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Vegas!  Can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
Well, we got the DEA coming down here again, I don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Dwayne please calm down!
I'll settle for a third of that.
Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
Winner six!
And I got mine, meaning you.  Nice how that works out.  I'm serious this time, I'm closing this place down.
I'm sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  But hey, I understand.  Make yourself at home, Isabella.  Champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  My ship is your ship.
This is your ship?
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
Oh, you American?
That's right.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.
Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Just relax and don't worry about a thing.  I'll hook you up in there.  You got condoms?
I knew you were lying.
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
What'd I say?
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
How you doin'?
That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down.
This is a very dangerous man.
Detective Yu?  Never met him.
It sounds impossible --
Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word.
Pick it up!
Get it out of here!
She saved our lives.
Is it the same heaven, or is it a Chinese heaven?
Mind your own business.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
Are you serious?
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
Red Dragon.
Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again!
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?
No, Carter.  I can't take this.
I always wanted to go to Madison Square Garden.  See the Knicks play.
Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation.
Why don't you go get them?
I didn't know which side you were on.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
The police can protect you.
I know, but --
Where were we?
The license!  You get it?!
No.
Did you make the plate?!
When a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  There is no need to rub it in his face.  The smell is the same.
Stool pigeon.
You talk too fast.
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
Good God, ya'll!
No, fish is a PM food.
What a surprise!
The Feds?!
This whole thing is goin' down tonight. I need to know where the Ambassador is gonna be. The Feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. You thing you can do that?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Hello.
I was trying to find the right time.
What do you expect me to say to this?
That's it.  Back to obedience school.
We do it to our dog.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
No, that's what makes you unemployed.
Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
You're coming here?
Then come for dinner.
Guess you'd know about that.  You're an entomologist, right?  How's business?
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
Thank you.
Twice...
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Highly suspect.
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is "King of Blue"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this?
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
A little longer for me.
I'm okay with that.
Yes, I did.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Why?
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
Lighten up, wahine.
Lighten up, what?
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Let's go.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
So I've come to see it as a bonus, really, that we've been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
I hate boats.
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
We'll stay at the Plaza --
Go for a walk in Central Park --
What is it?
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
What's with you?
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
What?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
You're going to miss the train.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
Maybe you should see a shrink.
Annie, when you meet someone and you're attracted to them, it just means that your subconscious is attracted to their subconscious, subconsciously.  So what we think of as chemistry is just two neuroses knowing that they are a perfect match.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
Are his folks nice?
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Mom!
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Sure you do.
Grace the dispatcher.  Great.
Yeah.
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
No.
It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
It is not --
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
You'll find out.
You'll see.
You'll like it.
Eighty dollars.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
Will she scratch up your back?
Just this one part, okay?  "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
What are you doing up?
Have you seen my wallet?
What's wrong with Annie?
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
You <u>are</u> the first woman I'm going out with.
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
Well?
How goes it?
Who? A scab?
You weren't even there. You were back at the station. Kalinsky told me ...
Can we light the candles now? On the cake?
So they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
What's more important than sanitation?
Over my dead body.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Ramón -- you can't.
Like what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Forgot what?
The what!
Don't I have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
Not even a guess?
Ride 'em cowboy)
Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Leave me out of this.
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
We been through that.
I need my paycheck.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
Why not?
What's wrong, Danny?
They would have killed you too.
What is it?
I don't want to leave you.
What?
What time is it?
Nice dealer you got there, Jimmy.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Don't get carried away.
I'm getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if I can get the right price.
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Palmdale
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
I think on account of his nose.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
When? When did you ever see me use?
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
By not disgracing her memory!
Crank or glass?
Not bad.
So that's 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
Pooh-Bear. come on, man.  What is this?  It's me, Danny. I thought we had a deal.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
It's not my place.
Question is, what are you doing here?
Someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
For that old possession charge? Gimme a break.
Whatever you say, man.  Look ... can we talk about this?
This the guy?
Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
Then why didn't you help the kid when you were there?
I'll tell you why you didn't help - because you're a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  You're a bottom feader, Flynne.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
A virtuoso rendition.  TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
Again, I thank you.
Tom, quit fucking around.
Where are your men now?
Jackson?
Yes, sir.
What do you think?
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Not yet.
A paratrooper named Ryan.  He's going home, if he's alive.
It was nothing.
Over three-hundred.
The men said, nine.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Goddamn it, sir...
GO!
Caen?
Some private up there lost three brothers, got a ticket home.
Beasley's dead.
Maybe.
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?
What was the name of that kid at Anzio, the one who got his face burned off?
Vecchio.
Bits and pieces.
Sarge, see what you can do to make those buildings inhospitable.
What are we going to do?
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
Well, sir, in purely arithmetic terms, since when does six equal one?  What's the sense in risking six guys to save one?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Sir, if you were not a captain, I would compliment you, now, for being an excellent liar.
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
I don't like that one.
You set?  Sarge nods.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
Yes, Private.
That's because, as I have pointed out on numerous occasions, you are a happy idiot.
You think he really believed it?
Twenty-four-five.
Mr Court, be aware that we will be contacting a number of your business associates...
This evening is over.
I hope you understand.
Why can't you be his uncle and not his playmate?
I was hilarious once, wasn't I?
I'll be in my office.
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
He wants to leave things on a good note.
Meaning?
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
I'm sorry.
I won?
Which they did.  Let me finish.
I'm fine.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
You're going.
Do you love him?
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change.  People change.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
No, but you stole from them.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
That's right, work it out.
Hi.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Thank-you.  The real world.
Yeah.
So you're monumentally busy?
Well, not monumentally.
Hmmm....
Well...
Eight.
Eight. Eight O' clock.
Have a good sleep.
What did you say?
No.
I just can't have any social life right now.
Little more gas.  Ease it up.  Hold on- minor setback.  Now you feel confident, right?
Check your mail tomorrow.  I sent you a letter, a letter.
I think that we should spend some time apart.
What do you want?
You do?
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey.  Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
Jim Court?
Fine Lloyd.
Thanks Lloyd.
Are you?
She's very successful.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I don't know.
Give me my firebird keys!
Should I stay?
We're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
When?
Yeah, all right, don't tell me, I'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me I can't figure it out.
What's that?
You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
This is not my problem.
That's great, thanks.
Thank you.
I need a drink.
He doesn't deserve your loyalty.  More important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
Once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. Don't you think?
Pots and pans.
Yes.
Better this month than last?
Christmas presents.
Are you losing money?
No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
Eight hundred, give or take.
That's very generous of you.
They're withholding payment.
There will be generations because of what you did.
File a grievance with the Economic Office, it's your right.
What? I can't hear you...
Hang up...call...
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
That's too bad.
Did it?
Its perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. Im the victim.
Its over, Cotton.
Tons and tons.
Lemme take you home.
Damned if I know. She ditched me.
Of course not. Who wants to? Whats the point if we dont get caught? Wheres the glamour in that?
You have every right to be upset.
What are we looking for?
A bloody knife. A ghost mask. Something like that?
This is all too familiar.
Jesus Christ!
Dewey?
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Just in case...
You're getting obvious.
Yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. I really should hate you... I see your movie's getting good reviews.
It's good to see you involved.
Are you in danger now?
I have rehearsal.
Shut up. Mickey, you and I can take her late evening.
Who is that guy?
No, Hallie, not tonight. Parties and mass murderers don't go together. Trust me.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
Oh, Sid, youre sounding desparate. I guess fearing death makes one anxious.
Perfect. I'll be outta Micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
Hello?
She's not here right now.
Now why does she have to be naked? How does that serve the plot?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
We can still Sandra Bullock it.
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
All I'm saying is I'm gonna be royally p.o.'d if you don't catch my acting debut.
Hello.
Who is this?
Really? You're such a talented actor.
More of a game really.
That's Sidney Prescott's mother.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
OK, look.  We all know that this has something to do with 'Stab 3'.  What we do not know is why the killer keeps leaving articles about Maureen Prescott.
Hmm.
I used to think I had the perfect mom, perfect family.  Till I found out I was wrong.  She had a secret life, and I tried to understand that, and soon as I thought I had, more secrets.  I don't' know who my mom was.  Sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about my mother for the first time. You know, with TV and those movies and what not. God sometimes I feel like I'm just learning about myself for the first time. Like I'm watching my life instead of living in it.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Detective Kincaid?
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Don't worry Sid I'd never leave you like that.
This has everything to do with me Dewey. I was the one who brought the nation's attention to this shit anyway. I'll be damned if I'm gonna sit around and pass on the buck again.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
What about me?
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro, 'The only place that's real!'  But now you're here. Not with me.  Dewey, I took care of you.  I waited until you were well.  I couldn't stay there, I mean, it's like dog years, one year in Woodsboro is like seven everywhere else.
I already removed it.  I think someone on the film was trying to find Sid, and that's the only reason I came here. To make do a little private investigating of my own and make sure no one here was planning anything.
I'm sorry, this is too good!
What part of 'Off the record' don't you understand?
Right. Sorry.  Do you think he did it? 
I've got my suspicions but still, nothing  you say can ever make me take my eyes off one person.
Jennifer needs me.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
Gale, I know this is a bad time and all but what if we try it out again. The whole relationship thing.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Roman.
AND I DIE NAKED?!  UGH! This is complete bullshit. Who wrote this piece of crap?
What the hell are you doing?
Yeah.
Gale Weathers. What a surprise.
Tom Prinze, tanked as usual. That's a shocker.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
We did some researching in the archives. Sid, something dawned on me when I wrote the book on your mother's murder. For two years of her life, 1969 up until 1971 she basically disappeared off the face of the Earth.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
I know!
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
I'm a director Sid, I direct. For example, Angelina over there,  She's my partner. I can convince her to do anything.  We've been dating since I met her in Woodsboro.
Goddamnit I am getting so fed up with these re-writes. It's like every five minutes there's a new script. God, and you just know this all because of STAB 2's script winding up on the internet two months after it wrapped shooting.
Would you give that script a rest? It's like a friggen umbilical cord to you.
No.
Always hard being friends with you, Sidney. When you're friends with Sidney, you die! Well these friends don't have to, Sidney. It's up to you.
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
What? She asked.
Owwww...
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
Duh... that's quick.
It's on the table.
I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'.
I know. He called again last night at Tatum's house.
When are you gonna let that go, Sid? When my mom left my dad -- I just accepted it. This is the way it is. She's not coming back.
But this is life. This isn't a movie.
Who did you call?
I called my dad.
You don't still think it was me?
Why did you kill my mother?
Who are you trying to reach?
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Guess.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Why? You wanna ask me out?
Why do you want to know my name?
I want to now who I'm talking to.
Gotta go.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.
I'm getting scared.
Please don't hurt him.
Come on. It'll be fun.
Michael... Michael Myers.
Now for the real question.
...please... no...
Don't make me... I can't... I won't.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
He's not a suspect, is he?
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious.
You're sure it was the Hilton?
At the airport.
He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel?
God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN.
Have they found my father?
Afraid not.
Hank Loomis' kid? Aw... Jesus...
That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
She's with my sister. Should I bring her in?
Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.
Uh-huh.
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you.
LEAVEMEALONE!
...so call if you need me.
I'm gonna gut your ass in a second.
If you were the only suspect in a senseless bloodbath would you be standing in the horror section?
The why'd the police let him go?
He came to make up.
Why are they doing this?
No prob. I'll pick you up after practice.
Tell your mom I said thanks.
Don't worry. Casey and Steve didn't bite it til way after ten.
Grant Goodeve -- the oldest brother on EIGHT IS ENOUGH. Remember that show? He was the one who lived off alone. He would come around every now and then with his guitar and sing "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." He had all these brain dead sisters and that idiot brother from CHARLES IN CHARGE. God, I was in love with Grant, he was so hot. The show came on every day after school right during my puberty years. Grant Goodeve was very instrumental in my maturing as a woman.
I thought you dumped her for me.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
You don't.  It goes to court now.
"Dear Detectives, Long is the way, and hard, that out of hell leads up to light." It's the murderer's way of announcing himself.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
Somerset...
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
This doesn't make any sense.
You go to movies at least?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
Gould's wife.  She was away on business. If this means she saw anything, I don't know what.  We've questioned her at least five times.
And, if it's a threat.
Right.  But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.  The sins are in a different order.
You're sure your men didn't move this?
What the fuck is that?
I've seen the same.  I'm not the country hick you seem to think I am.
How was it?
I want him bad.  I don't just want to catch him anymore.  I want to hurt him.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
How do those cockroaches get here so quick?
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
They monitor reading habits.  Not every book, but certain ones are flagged.  Books about... let's say, how to build a nuclear bomb, or maybe Mein Kampf.  Whoever takes out a flagged book has their library records fed to the F.B.I. from then on.
So they ran our list.
How do you know all about this?
I'm fine.
We could use about fifty more men here.
No.  Face it now.  Stop thinking it's good guys against bad guys.
How can you say that?  Especially after today?
People don't want a champion.  They just want to keep playing the lottery and eating hamburgers.
No I'm not!  I'm talking about common, everyday life here.  If you let yourself worry about one thing, you'll worry about the next, and the next, and it never ends. In this place, ignorance isn't just bliss, it's a matter of survival.
He cut her up and dressed the wounds.
No.
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!
Don't do this... please...
Are you absolutely certain?
High school and college, yes.  Pretty hokey, huh?  I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry.  God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
Well, I got up one morning and went to work... just like any other day, except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I... I felt this fear and anxiety washing over me.  I looked around, and I thought, how can we raise a child surrounded by all this?  How can a child grow up here?  So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have it, and over the next few weeks, I convinced her it was wrong.  I mean... I wore her down, slowly.
Got a warrant?
I didn't give any order to fire!
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
Is Captain Clayton here, Reverend?
Leggo my arm...You look mangier 'n ever.
Come f'r my rockin' chai'...ole Mose.
Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Easy on that!
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
I think maybe we oughta...
Nine...  Ten!
How? She's even forgot her own language!
Wait! We go chargin' in, they'll kill her...and you know it.
Not far from it...
Well, you did all a body could, Ethan.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Don't go takin' that stuff...
Might at least have left me my pants!
I...I wrote you a letter...Reckon you didn't get it...
Stop that!
Hey... the fuse.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  And this stuff is hazardous to your health.
We just have to make a new beginning.
Cherry-red Tears.
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?
What? What am I supposed to sense?
Maybe an animal.
Let me guess:  Another short circuit?
You know what I have to do now, and believe me:  I don't enjoy doing this.
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.
Mrs. Straub!
Well, look here!
Damn, this thing is heavy. Where do you want to have it?
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Ohwhat have I done?
I know your face. Are you an actor?
Really?
You have the money?
Twenty pounds on delivery
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
The Queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the Master of the Revels favours us.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
There is no dog in the first scene, Will Kempe, thank you. How goes it Will?
Romeo
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Of course not!
This time we take your boots off!
But nothing is happening.
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
No, it will turn out well.
Another little problem.
The show must  you know
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
The daughter of his enemy.
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
My lady, this play will end badly. I will tell.
Your Majesty.
And I love poetry above all.
I am, Master Shakespeare.
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
"Then have my lips the sin that they have took."
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Like you, I found him not at home!
You have opened the playhouses?
My lady!
Oh my lady, my love!
Even your play.
Oh
Moonlight!
Let him be damned for his pages!
Oh, do not go
You never spoke so well of him.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
You cannot marry Wessex!
Nono.
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day> It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
But why me?
Good morning, my lord!
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
He is dead?
Are you Mr. Shakespeare?
She loves me, Thomas!
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
I was trying to educate you.
You're a bad loser.
I saw my grandmother, of course, but I don't suppose that counts. I mean, she was alive at the time.
Come on, David.
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
You know what. Who's going to do it.
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
I don't know.
Is this necessary?
Listen, it's important. We need to talk about what we're going to do --
From what? Jehovah's Witnesses?
Nothing.
What for? What did you want? The money? Was that it?
Your friends.
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't deep enough, but you wouldn't listen.
It doesn't neccessarily matter. They don't even know who those people are, and even if they did, they have nothing to connect them with us, nothing at all.
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex. It makes us feel a whole lot better.
But they know.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
About the mail --
Where do you think you'll go?
What does it look like?
No. Why should it?
I don't know them.
Just one thing.
What?
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
The man we know and love.
Yeah.
What sort of car?
Be careful.
No, I don't.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
I don't see the point in that.
Leave him alone.
He can't stay up there.
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
We could put it somewhere.
Expecting anyone?
No.
No, definitely not. And that's that. I refuse to discuss it further.
Interesting.
It's OK. There's no problem.
It's about the burglary.
Of course.
Why do you want a room here?
I'm sorry.
We already know. All about it.
Eh, I don't know.
Well, it's a wide range of, eh --
Oh, him. Well, he died.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Writing seems easy.
And he's a patient of yours?
For what?
You know about it?
That sounds fine.
Chicken salad.
I thought you were in a good mood.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
I just thought you'd like to know --
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
What are you talking about?
Gee, that's very serious...
What about?
I hope she's all right.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
No, I know.
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
... what?...
Are you?
It isn't?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
Shit.
You here to see my mother?
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I do her hair, yeah.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
How is she?
Right.
You do it.
How long you had this?
I'm sure.
He's a very private person, actually.
You would?
Why not?
Did Lester know about him?
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Yeah, baby...
No you didn't.
Sammy's?
He still having parties?
-- what?
-- ass and legs --
Why?
I've got to leave?
Where are you going?
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
God, there's Lester...
What?
Oh yeah?
Wash her.
Not yet.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Keep moving --
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
I am?
Honey?
Yeah.
Yeah, baby...
Whether or not I'm going.
When is that?
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I know, honey.
Television or movies?
-- well aren't you --
I don't want to fight, George.
Obviously.
What do you wanna know for?
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
Did you?
George...
Thank you.
It's good you want to do something, George.
They're not?
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Sorry, honey, I...
What about, tonight?
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
I don't know what to...
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
No thanks.
Have a drink.
What took you so long?

Come on by.
What do you mean?
And?
Yes.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Is that right?
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
Who were you talking to?
Shut the door, shut the door!
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Jackie Shawn.
Poster-Kleiser.
I know, I'm sorry.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
That's right.
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
-- never mind.
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
Well... sure...
That bastard.
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
You're going?
You're kidding.
Thank you.
Are you sure?
No, I'm scared of nothing here. It's just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  I guess you could say the Overlook Hotel here has something about it that's like shining.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
It's so pretty.
Red Rum.
Red Rum.
But eh what was the matter with him?
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
Sure.
Glad to meet you, Winifred.
Yeah.  We call him Doc sometimes, you know, like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.  But how did you know that?
I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
Well this ought to be quite a change for you.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.
Yes, I did.
I...
You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
Of course I am.
Stay away from me,
Stay away from me!
Wendy give me the bat.
Go away.
Give me the bat.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Only in a very general way.
Well...
I don't believe they did.
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
This is our Colorado Lounge.
Thanks.
Hi.
Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
Sure, Uncle Al.
You always take his side because he's a cripple! Well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
Come on, Jane- it was Brady's idea. I couldn't stop him.
Rats...
You all right, Marty?
Huh?
It's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. Not bad, huh? I read Sherwood Anderson in college. I can jive that shit all day.
I don't get you.
I don't know. But I know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, Marty. You had a dream, that's all. An extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
I come here because Marty needs a friend.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY SPIRIT
LET THY SPIRIT
What you do?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
Is that why you came up here, Christy? To thank me?
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
Oh-huh.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
Why?
Isn't it lovely?  Now I'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  You just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  Then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  Shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  Keep tension on the warp.  Is that clear?
Just about.  Show me again.
What is it, Mary?
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
It's true -- I know her.
Like this place?
Of course.  I'm a nun.  Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug?
Three years.  A rookie.
You have to help me
Mary Clarence!
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
A convent?  They put me in a convent? What's the problem?  Wasn't there any more room in Hell?
What is your full name?  Your Christian name?
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
And all those like you.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.
You were right the first time.  Is this like, solitary?  The cooler?  Where's the furniture?
You will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  As almost no one attends Mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
I was thinking Las Vegas.  Get some butts in those seats.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
But... wait a minute...
What about me, Reverend Mother?  I think you were right.  I'm just a bad influence.  Sister show biz.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Ten flights?
What'd she say?
Jesus, look at you   You're glowing.
I am?
Vince knows you're here.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Jesus.  Data-base hoods.  It's a wonderful world.  Beloved daughter missing.  Reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. Please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  Dead or alive.
Where's who?
Right.
Are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
Yes?
Is this like your old convent?
We can't sing without her!  What should we do?
You mean -- they kidnapped her?
Mary Clarence -- you're alive!
She's a nun, Vince.
Who took the meat?
Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods.
What are you spying on?
Bring him.
I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds.
Is that all you say?  Look at her.
What is it?
It's spectacular.
No, I couldn't...
What is it?
Listen.
Should we go back?
What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
This is farewell.
Small talk.
Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women?
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
There is no such thing as magic.
You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible.
Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it.  The bird seems to be in his cage.
I insist that you have it.
Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want?
To avenge his father, and the others.
Lady Van Tassel... she is your stepmother, isn't she?  She bears so little resemblance.
She is not your birth mother, is she?
What would you have me believe?
The church.
I hear him.  He rides to the Hollow and back.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
No.
All right then. I'll see you bright and early. How you comin' along on that garden tiller?
He won't have anything to do with him. Now you say it's all right for him to stay out here in the back?
I was kindly wantin' somethin' or 'nother d'eat.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
It's too big.
Hey Freddy, what's goin' on boy. I seen your pitcher in the paper for catchin' that big-ass bass.
I ain't sayin' it's right. I'm just tellin' the truth. What was he in the nuthouse for?
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
Okay, I'll leave and sober up. Everything's botherin' me, that's all. I'm hurtin' Linda. I love you.
Doyle, don't you lay one hand on her.
Different ones. The Bible's one of 'em.
On the bass, give it up for Terence "One Ball" Atkins.  On the tambourine and lyrics Morris Hobbs the fuckin' genius of the group.  On drums "The Johnson."  And last and most importantly, Doyle Hargraves on rhythm guitar and business affairs and the only motherfucker with a truck big enough to haul this outfit on the next world fuckin' tour. Come on, a big hand for these guys. They're workin' their asses off here.  Okay I'd like to dedicate this next one to some very special people in our audience tonight. To my lovely female companion Linda, her lovely son Frank, our new boarder Karl - what's your last name Karl?
I want to be baptized.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
My mother's dead. My daddy's s'posed to be around still. He don't want to have nothin' to do with me though.
'Cause he didn't have enough money to take care of us the way he wanted to. That's what the letter said. He got laid off from work and had to just work odd jobs. I thought he took care of us fine.  Karl, did you really kill somebody?
Who did you kill?
Well, I hate him.
I reckon if you want me to.  I got some of that potted meat and sodie crackers left over if you want some.
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
So it died when it come out?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
You will? For sure?
Them boys was tryin' to pull me down pretty hard.
It don't matter to me about us losin' does it to you?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
Okay. I give you my word. Is ever'thing gonna be okay? Are you all right?
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?
Naw.
I reckon.
Do they know about you?
Yes ma'am.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
I wouldn't never hurt them.
I was thinkin' I could use me another helpin' of these potaters.
I think Karl is going to be a writer or a librarian eventually. You should see all the books he has. He must read constantly.
He's been in the state hospital a long time, something must be wrong with him.
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
I thought you'd be happy to leave.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Before they were married?
I don't think so. Just period, I think. She told him... God gave them the ugliest creation he could think of. Karl has an entire book -- a notebook. On every page it says "Franklin Chapter 1 Verse number 1." He wrote that a few years ago after he'd learned to write. His father's name was Franklin.
But, here's the thing. He'll only talk to you. He doesn't want you to ask him anything. And you shouldn't stare at him.
I hope the best for you, Miss Dwiggins, with your school and your paper and all.
Will he be supervised?
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
I'd love to.
What's that, Sol?
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
The boys and I were just having a philosophical discussion about women and cigars. Some interesting connections there, don't you think?
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
A photographer ...
The kid's sorry, Auggie.
It's written all over you like a neon sign. Now say something nice to Rashid to make him feel better.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Anything good?
Good? Of course. Are you kidding?  I'll tell you what. Buy me lunch, my friend, and I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. How's that? And I guarantee every word of it is true.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
And now you've got your Christmas story, don't you?
I mean, it's a good story.
At least I've stayed true to myself. Which is more than I can say about some people.
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
You what?
Yeah, like what?
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
It's all yours, baby.
I don't know. Thirteen, fourteen years. Something like that.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Speaking of which, are you still going ahead with that deal on the Montecristos?
Suit yourself. But don't keep the boxes around here long.
Seventeen.
What do you care where it comes from? It's yours.
Your job? You've got five thousand bucks. What do you want a piece-of-shit job like that for?
A good choice. You wouldn't want to celebrate the birth of your firstborn with a box of stinkers, would you? Remember to keep them in the refrigerator until you hand them out.
The refrigerator?
What does that mean?
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
I'm looking for my nephew,  Thomas.
Thomas? Who's Thomas?
I just want to know where he is.
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
No thank you.
Has anything happened lately? Anything unusual or unexpected?
It can't have been easy on him. Walking around with that on his conscience all these years.
You going to sit here all day?
Just passing through. A lonesome traveler with a knapsack on his back plops himself across from my garage to admire the view. There's other places to roam, kid, that's all I'm saying. You don't want to make a nuisance of yourself.
Benefits?
And have you mended them?
Well what?
Of course there's gonna be a war. You think they'd send five hundred thousand troops over there just to lie in the sun? I mean, there's plenty of beach, but not a hell of a lot of water. Half a million soldiers. It ain't no seaside holiday, you can bet on that.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Just one bottle. I believe in moderation.
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
In case you're wondering, I like women, not little boys. And I'm not offering you a long-term lease -- just a place to crash for a couple of nights.
Is your father an artist?
Drawing's a good thing.
Eight-thirty?
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Maybe. Or maybe it's the other people who don't belong.
Celebrate? What for?
Here we are.  Rembrandt's drawings. Edward Hopper. Van Gogh's letters.
His only copy?
That's it. In a nutshell.
It wasn't my fault.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Yes, please.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
And the blood could <u>not</u> have belonged to defendant.  Seeing that his type is O negative.
None.
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
So that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, doesn't it?  If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
It is.
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
Happy for him.  And relieved.
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
I can just feel my spirits soar.
It's just Pearl Harbor.  People are a little crazy, right n...
Did you write that column?
It was my specialty, sir, I trained several thousand over the years.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  With that last one.  Would those cleats have lined up?
Greedy.
And then your stroke came this summer.  And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7.  Which, remember, is <u>eight</u> days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
They got transferred that day. Out to Cape Flattery.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
You're wondering why I held it.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Now you believe there were <u>two</u> lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand.  The second lashed to the mast.
Maybe...?
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks <u>believe</u> is true. That's sad.  And it's real.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
So your husband said he's think it over.  Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
Those 'dirty looks'.  Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
I...see.  I'm not sure I quite get your...point...
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Get lost, will you?
It's from Satchel Mouth at Table Seven.  This is from me to you, doll.
What did he say?
Because I lost a filling in my back tooth. I gotta go to the dentist tomorrow.
Of course I am.
Suppose Lake Michigan overflows?
It did?  Boy, did it ever!
Nellie told us about it.
You mean it's a girls' band?
All the way to Urbana - for a one night stand?
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
Not there - that's the emergency brake.
You'd better go fix it.
Look - no butter, no pastry, and no Sugar!
Men?
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
I got pinched in the elevator.
Well, now you know how the other half lives.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
You - you -
I heard a very sad story about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.  She squealed on her roommate, and they found her strangled with her own brassiere.
Oh.
Look, Jerry - take my advice - forget the whole thing - just keep telling yourself you're a boy!
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
I feel like such a tramp - taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses.
Joe -
Sugar?
Since when?  Usually you leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.
That's when I was a saxophone player. Now I'm a millionaire.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
All right - so what do we do now?
She sings, too.
Oh - Sugar!
It must be freezing outside.  When I think of you - and your poor ukulele -
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
Interesting.
I have a very low resistance.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
That's from carrying around the bull fiddle.
His yacht?
Yeah.  This is one for Ripley.
What for?
Junior gave it to me.  It must have at least thirty stones -
I was it.
What's wrong with us?
Help yourself.
Let me carry one of the instruments.
It certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here.
I'm not surprised.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Fascinating.  Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it?
Why?
Who?
About that roadhouse -
Another bridesmaid?
We'll adopt some.
What's the job?
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Then why did you take this job?
Have you ever been with a male band?
I can't trust myself.  The moment I'd start with a new band - bingo!
You know - I play tenor sax.
Brains aren't everything.
That's a quarter of a century. Makes a girl think.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Millionaires.  Flocks of them.  They all go south for the winter.  Like birds.
Forget it, Sugar, will you?  Forget about saxophone players.  You're going to meet a millionaire - a young one.
Well, don't worry.  I won't sue you - no matter who you are.
Thank you.
Not at all.
Your face is familiar.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
Could be.  Do you play the market?
Well - a group of us are appearing at the hotel. Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.
Syncopators - does that mean you play that fast music - jazz?
Good school!  And your family doesn't object to your career?
You're very kind.  I'll bet you're also very gentle - and helpless -
Josephine.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
What's on Thursdays?
Completely.
Ever since then -  numb - no feelings.  Like my heart was shot full of novocaine.
Is that anything?
Maybe if you saw a good doctor...
Anything this time?
Would you like a little more champagne?  And maybe if we had some music -  - how do you dim these lights?
Thank you.
Not tomorrow, either.  You see, I have to leave - something unexpected came up - I'm sailing right away.
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Daphne -
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
You're wasting the taxpayers' money.
Ever hear of the DeLuxe French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?
Why?
I sleep with my spats on.
You and who else?
I already told you.
Hi, Spats.  We was laying eight to one you wouldn't show.
Why wouldn't I?
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
You know what I love about all this?
I should get going.
Whatever you do, dont mention Italy. Or politics. Or baby buggies.  Or Edith Piaf.
Moms refining her strategy for DDay.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
Whats going on with you two?
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Ah, a philosopher.
Let me guess. Amy presumed Id forget the rings.  I think Im her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
So, whats your point?
Im sorry?
What color are my shoes?
Six thousand, right?
What is?
This happened to you?
Dont stop asking questions, okay?
I swear. I dont have a signature move.
Is this for last night?
What?
You have had girlfriends?
And thats when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Youre right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Nice speech. I thought it was touching... and funny.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
Im worried. Amys not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it drunker or drunker-er?
I just wanta wash my hand. It's got blood where I hurt it.
Thank you, Miss Johnson.
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
Nothin'...
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
Yes, sir...
David Lee...
You bet we is!
From Miss Johnson --
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
I don't look like no possum!
I guess I'll havta work harder to git him back like he usta be.
Where did it come from, Mama?
Who's winning, Mama?
Any sign of Sounder?
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
Come, I'll take you home.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Whatcha wanta order?
Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
Where you goin'!?
But, Nathan--
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
What... are you?
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!
They're burning all the Canadian stuff cause of the war.
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
But they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
This is all cause of your mom, Kyle. She's such a bitch-  AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.
Come on, just get to the message board!
We're not gonna have pie and punch!
Your behind?
You guys! Seriously! You guys!
Mph rmpmh rm.
No you can't Kenny!
Goodnight, honey.
Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz all my favorite TV shows have been replaced by news and it's pissing me off.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
What was that word, young man!?
Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Yes I am!
Mph rmph rm!
MOM!!!
SHIT!
Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and Phillip?
Be careful, dude.
Wow, a lot of people showed up.
Thank you, Kenny.
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
What did my son say, Principal Victoria? Did he say the S word?
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by The Conan O'Brian Show!!
Who's my cream puff?
Oh I love when you get all biblical Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my crank!
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
What did you do today Satan?
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Check.
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!
Oh yeah...
Oh yeah...
Uh, yes I am.  And you are?
Were you going to give it to them?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
What, and leave you here all by your lonesome?
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
You're not helping my heart condition any, Barnes!  Now just what the hell are you dragging your ass for?
Well maybe there's a way out of here.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.  Besides, what could we use for tools?  A steak knife?  A corkscrew?
Why can't we?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
He certainly is polite.
But you can't be sure!  It's suicide.  You have to come with us!
Thanks for everything, Taylor. Will I see you again?
Sooner than later.
So close...
Will you marry me?
No, just enjoying the view.
Homesick?  It's only been two days!
How am I supposed to know?
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
You a mini-golfer?
Haven't seen a ball like that since '69.
You tried to make it look like Junior trashed his place. Junior's underground in that coffin you dicks put him in.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
Well, Mr. Fazeli, the Bowling Congress says I'm a thorn in their side.
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
What do you think I can do?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
It's gonna be bigger than big. Think Europe. Think Asia. They don't have room for real golf courses in Japan.
I'm more of a bowler than you'll ever be. I deal with my own shit. I ain't asking anyone to bail me out.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
It depends.
Knock-knock.
Weird, comes into alleys and doesn't bowl.
You know who I am?
You need a sponsor; I have influence. I could sponsor you.
You already have a partner Mr. Kastle. Sheila walks over as the sleazeballs' car pulls out of the driveway.
See! No feeling. Tell Theo what happened to your hand, Junior.
Yeah.
Is Mr. Fazeli in please?
He's not here.
Buzz Fazeli never helps anybody but himself.
Do those two work for your dad or mine?
Do you know where they're taking him?
What do you want with my dad?
Kinda tough on the butt.
What does he do?
Not while I'm in training.
Do you have a boyfriend?
What's plan B?
I don't think your new outfit suits you, Theo.
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
More than you could afford.
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
I told him you were my boyfriend.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
Your word is so good, you're never gonna give it to anyone.
Some unfinished business.
Back away then.
Yeah.  I heard you.
There are procedures, Beth, that I want followed.  My procedures.  And considering what's going on, I want you to follow them very closely.
Direction's east coming!
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Increase positive pressure!
Don't do it, Norman!
Don't do it!
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.
What have you been told so far?
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Hold on --
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Bullshit.  What's out there isn't alien.  It's an animal.
Yes, sir.
I did.
Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in.
Who is that?  Where's that coming from?
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
I'd also like it noted --
Look at this.
It's not talking, it's mimicking.
Because when we get down there --
We have a library?
My gosh, Norman.
They have six tentacles.  A new species.  And the squid too.  They had no stomach.
Beth.
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
Where did you get this?
Maybe you should go.  To the sub.
But I don't know how --
Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
Looks like some sort of code.
Bingo.
Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
You tell me.
Did you?
Why did you go in the sphere, Beth?
That's bullshit.
Is it?
I promise --
Beth?
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.
Like what?  I'm not --
You're staring at me.
C'mon.
It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you.
What noise?
These aren't half bad, Fletcher.  You might have a second career coming.
That's right.
Fine.
Missed.
I'm trying to keep balance with --
Gimme a second --
No idea.
Less than a minute, we're never gonna make it.
A spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  Someone went to a lot of trouble.  Try again.
Hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? We're not a bunch of icy streets here.
... I asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  If you're trying to communicate, why use a code?
No other equipment?  Scientific instruments?
Barnes.  He's very eager to meet you. Been calling us every half hour to see if you're arrived.
This is like nursery school.
Well, he's polite.
You seen my suitcase?
The Empire must have gotten here first.
Well, I've brought you here.  What now?
You have your father's style.  You've done very well.
We'll be back before you are, old man.
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.
You're General Kenobi?!?  The Jedi knight!  The commander of the White Legions?
I know who you are.  Stand up so that we can talk properly.  You're embarrassing me.  I'm not that important.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Do the Sith know the ways of the Force?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, but I can get him...
Put that thing away or you're going to get us all killed.
Where are you taking us now anyway?
Well, I practice a lot...
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
Enough!  I already know about the data you've intercepted, but its' too late.  Whatever information you've gathered will be destroyed... You will come to know such suffering as only the Master of the Bogan Force can provide...
First thing tomorrow morning you're going to check those condensing units on the south ridge.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
Funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
No way. Big K taught me I ain't executive material.
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
What's the hurry ?
Yeah, but I want Carmen.
Please continue, Sergeant.
In simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
They revoke our flight status.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
She's flying starships !
Let's all make a vow. Let's swear we'll always be friends no matter what.
I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Johnny...! I thought you were dead !
Alright, take her out, Ibanez.
Report.
Sure.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Nah, I don't do that anymore...
All bands.
Oh, my, what's that ?
Geez, I don't think I've ever seen him smile.
Sir, yes it is, sir.
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
What is your position ?
The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
Uh, I don't know.
Then V'ger must withdraw its orbiting devices.
Our data is being prepared.
What is Enterprise's proper evolvement?
Enterprise would be unable to function <U>without</U> carbon units.
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.
You'll stay aboard as Executive Officer... a temporary grade reduction to Commander.
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Then you acted properly, of course.
Thank you, sir. I'm sorry I embar- rassed you.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
Granted.
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away.
Exactly.  And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander.
Forward motion, Captain...!
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Reduce magnification. Factor 4, Mr. Sulu.
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters in operation, Mister Scott?
No vessel could generate a powerfield of this magnitude...
They had a pattern to follow...
Spock? Concerned about his chances?
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Why aren't you on board?
Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
Actually, I'm not sure if I quit.  I think that I got fired.  I'm such a liar. I never could tell the truth.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
Yes...
Yes...
What are you doing?  I love your script.
You bet your life.  "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
<u>Yes</u>...
The <u>Firehouse</u>...
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
Paperclip?
I don't drink.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
Later on.
But it's absurd.
Sure did.
Yes.
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
Carla was in the car, right?
If I go to jail...?
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>Although</u> it is altered..."
We did...?
Well, I <u>know</u>, because they <u>told</u> me you were with that writer from the, you see, this is what I mean, the whole <u>town</u> has been warped by the, by, by the presence of the movie company, they holler, and we jump, you have a <u>date</u>, they call, you're doing business nine o'clock at night.  It isn't...
Let me review here: You're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
I'm sorry.
Big day last night.
You know who the <u>father</u> is...?
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
I never touched her.  My mother's gr...
Whyn't you learn your lines?
The prices are going up.
I don't eat vegetables.
How old are you?
Are you all right...?
What...
Are you Okay?
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
I'm very sorry to...
I have to ask you these...um.  You have a valid drivers license...?
I'm an attorney, if there's anything you have to say to...
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
Aren't you ever in school?
And I have Mr. Barrenger's Tuna B...
Thank you.
Nobody.
It's a mistake.  It's all over.  I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
I wasn't in the car.
I want you to hear this.
Look.
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
I like you, too.
That's my...
Oh.
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
What...?
...they treat me like a <u>child</u>.  I, I...to bare my <u>body</u>.
Yes.
I...
Did she throw up?
I can't tell.
You said <u>three</u>...?
I, uh...I'm leaving.
I want you to hear this, pal...  Forget the overages, <u>forget</u> Ten Thousand Dollars for three days to two weeks.  You know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  Two Million Dollars!  Now:
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
My wife's going to have a baby.
Half a buck I'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your Barrenger, molesting little girls...
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
Hey, Joe...Good.  You know B...
I want to make a good film.
Grace, get on the other phone, call that girl: well, call her, and have whatsername send up some <u>nosh</u>...what do you like to drink...?
The movie's about <u>purity</u>.  So we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  We show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
No, what is it?
I have to tell the truth.
No.
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
They're coming Fedex...
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
Pay her off.
She wasn't in...you were al...
Don't you <u>touch</u> that...I want them gone.
And we're glad to have you here...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
...it is?
...the damn thing...
Yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
Ain't no second chances in life.
Zat true?
Ben!  What's wrong?
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
No I'm not.  I don't care.  Why should I care?  I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother.  Nobody even asked me if I like her.  If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
I can't hear you.
What's Thursd...
Great.
This'll work, huh?
I don't want to say goodbye.
Here.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Hold lunch!
I made you some cocoa.  See?
&quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Queen of diamonds.
No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
Ben where do you have to get to?
The world.  <u>Thinks</u> I'm gone.  But only the magician.  Knows better.
You say that like I don't know that.
I once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.
So we'll...radiate some more?
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Because you don't really seem here.
I'm here.  I've got a case where they're this close to sequestering the jury but have I answered the goddamn thing?!
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Easy enough.
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know.  I <u>said</u> I'd get 'em back tonight...
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
I grew up, a little.  I'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...
WE are over.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
It's temporary.
You want us to take him tonight? Give you some private time with Annab....
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
Yeh?
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Not personally.
Jackie?
You're a cross-dresser.
I really look like shit.
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Looks nice enough to m...
What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>?
You'll learn.
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.
Anyway, I thought...while I'm gone...maybe I'll hire in some help.
Look.  I know they hate me.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
They're my kids.
No problem.
What a great surpri...
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
I told her I loved her.
We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
I'll be your guest!
I'm always working.
Mi Jesusmi jesus
Jesus was not bad.
But really, you never know.
Why was he on Death Row?
Consuelo, what is rape exactly?
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
No, no, no. No exploitation. This is seriousBut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
OK, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
Hip alternative types who will understand the process better
Twinkeys!
Marty...
What are you going to do?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
Oh, I know, I know that. Well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can I hope, be an illuminating experience.
OK.
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Thanks.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Say, Ni...
Nigger.
OK.
C'mon. Talk to me. Tell me what you're thinking.
Toby Oxman.
I'm a documentary filmmaker.
Yeah...So you're um...you're married?
Doubt it.
So where'd you get in?
Can I see what you have so far?
He did?
I gotta keep you alive--it's in my contract.
What now?
We don't have time!
What's that supposed to mean?
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
What are you talking about?
We're on sublevel six.  We'll pass some labs and then we'll hit the stairwell--
How's the arm?
I suppose...you think I should thank you.
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Chemco makes many things senator! We were under government contract!
I say we head out.
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Drop the anchor!
Just what the hell is he talking about?
I have your word, Mister President?
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
Surely, you don't expect us to destroy our weapons without being able to verify that you are doing the same?
Goodbye, Mister Ambassador.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
That's right, fella.
That's government property, Major.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
General Schmuck?
To be perfectly honest, Mister President, we really aren't sure.
You see, you knew the answer all the time, General.
This is General Ripper speaking.
Condition Red!
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
I didn't mean for anyone to play anyone else's radio either, Major.
But -- why...that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
I know that, sir.
You're damned right they are.
That about right?
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.
Do you think they would cheat?
Look, sir.  I'm no expert on the subject, but I've read some pretty sharp ideas the big boys have.  Like, say, both countries agreeing to a million dollar reward and international protection for anyone who gives evidence of cheating to the inspectors. You can't hide those things without a lot of people knowing about it.  And if I were going to try and hide a few, I wouldn't want to depend on the fact that some poor slob isn't going to run and blab for a million bucks.  We're as smart as they are, and if they cheat, or even hold back information, we'd pull right out.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
I want to talk to General Ripper.
Naturally I am, sir.
Maximum ECM.
What?
War.
Main interference linked to electronic detector.  Fight interference on readi- ness state.
Shouldn't be bad.  Might even help.  But my guess is we're going to have to paddle our way back.
Roger.
I think they mean business.
Where'd they get you?
Second safety.
What happened?
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Sorry, King.
Well, I hate to say this, but I think the bomb bay doors are stuck.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Have you tried the emergency system?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
I think it's okay, King.  They should go off on impact.
In a matter of weeks, sufficient improvements for a dwelling space could be provided.
Mn-hm.
In Group?
How long were you in there?
Well, you shouldn't drink. Are you gonna drink?
I mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Uh, home, you know.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?
Yeah. There was this cloud and I video taped it.
It's your birthday?
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Wait, um, how do you figure that?
Oh, come on, man. Tell me you wouldn't love it!
A long, long, long...
So, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
No, no.
Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
Y- s-sure it did.
What?
What?
Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
No, no, no.
Ow! Hey! Get the heck in there!  Hey... Not dead! Definitely not dead!
Really?
Oh, you were in the band?
Shit.
Buff.
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much.  Did you get your tape?
You better! Yes!
He paid you man.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
You could do it.
Yeah.
Hey, play that demo again, man. Alright.
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
He is.
You cut off your little finger?
We were?
Two-fifty.
Yeah, well, he's from a Third World country. He doesn't have it easy.
Tim, what are you talking about?
See ya later.
Well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what I mean? Fuck. So they'll talk and talk. They'll probably talk all night. And, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? But, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. By six a.m. he's parking the pink Cadillac. Fuck. There's really only one answer.
Well, w-what happened?
What'd you do?
You know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? He's just gonna call the cops again.
No.
This is my home.
Look, why do you care, huh?
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Oh! Trim it!
I hate that.
No.
Name one.
No, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
Yes, I stand for -
What? What do you stand for?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Can I talk?
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Of course.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Okay, well, then, I'm gonna break new ground.
New ground?
No, no. I just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? I mean, I felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
To his hotel?
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Aw, come on. Rock star. Fame. Fortune. Sex.
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Like songs?
Well, I, I didn't say I was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. You know what I mean? If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
Get off my roof!
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
You do not want me to do your cover.
I'm always serious.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
If...
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
Fucking drunk, huh?
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
This is great - GREAT!  Now we have to enter the front door!
Oh for Chrissakes...  "White trash Betty."  I didn't realize the rules went into effect before we entered Safeway.
Another sex dream?
Di, we're sorry.  We...
Hello?
Di?  I just called to say that Conan talked about us again last night.
Thanks, Cleo.  See you tomorrow.
Diane?  Diane!
Oh my G-d, I read about this!  It's called a "pregnancy insanity."  Quick, she needs a sitz bath --
I see a flower.  And y'know, even the most beautiful flowers still grow from dirt.
Nope.  Sounds more like the first.
Kansas!
Yeah?
Or, I could get my own horse...
...my Sunday School teacher says that in prison, women shove broom sticks up your...
Then I'll throw a few more treats on the plate.  Where's my smokes?
So could half the women in here.  And I'd rather go out with a nice can... So watcha here for?  To say how much you hate me or how much your grandparents hate me...
Your help.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
More proof God's a guy...
Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
Nothing for Ladd?
Carefull Those are dirty words! You sound like a bunch of New York critics.  Thank you, Miss Schaefer.
If I could be of any help...
I've been hoping to run into you.
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
O.K.  I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
So do I.
I'll say.  This is solid gold.
I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe.
Why not?
I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself?
Come on, Joe.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay.  I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again.  You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
I wouldn't know.
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
I had some trouble with my car. Flat tire.  I pulled into your garage till I could get a spare. I thought this was an empty house.
It is not.  Get out.
Are you or aren't you?
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
It certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
I will not have it butchered.
Of course not.  But it ought to be organized.  Just an editing job.  You can find somebody.
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
I want to talk to you for a minute.

Shouldn't we wait for the others?
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
I don't think so.  It's your script.  It's your show. Good luck.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
Good night.
Good.
No you didn't.  You took the car.
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
What are you doing, Joe?  What are you doing?  You're not leaving me?
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
It's yours, Joe.  I gave it to you.
Norma, you'd be throwing it away. I don't qualify for the job, not any more.
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
No, I haven't.  I suppose all the waxworks are coming?
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
Joseph C. Gillis?
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
Any kind of assignment.  Additional Dialogue.
Look, Mr. Sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
But the Power Source, Zaltar.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Home?
I'm sorry, but I already promised Bianca she could have Switzerland. You know how she loves to ski.
Wait...don't leave me in here...
What's happening?
Don't leave me.
Who didn't?
My angel. My goddess. I feel I've always loved you all my life. I'll die if I can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
Yes. It reminds me of home.
Why not ?
No.
You're not afraid are you?
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
But why?
I know I was acting funny---I'm sorry. It's just...I miss it.
Finished your estimate?
I bet they do.
Well...I guess I can't.
Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?
Say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with Lucy?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
Your hair looks the same.
No thanks. You go on.
Lucy; come back!
Thank you both so much. It was a lovely lunch, Mrs. Danvers. I had a wonderful time. And you're a terrific chess player MR. Danvers.
Nigel, get out of here. And don't come slithering back. Nigel shakes his head.
Balefire on you, Selena!
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the Great Mother to protect us... Why. are you staring at me like that?
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
You would! You revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
What's it like?
Where is inner space?
They'll be grateful. If you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. Look, up ahead.
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
It's dangerous to use a Power Source on Earth. It can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Then come with me.
Goodbye...
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Brad.
The kid needs a man to show him --
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
I didn't --
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
Well, it's true you have to be careful things don't spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
Peanut butter and jelly.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
No, what you said before, Could I make it in Metropolis? I've dreamed about it, sure, but I never really thought about it.  What would I do when I got there?
Well, aren't you excited?
Gee, I always loved porch swings.
Mr. White, please, I promised those people I'd get back to them by this morning. What do you think?
Yeah.
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
How many sugars?
Quittin' time, Gus. Comin'?
Gus?
First question got to be "Where."
Turn on the T.V.
Uh...what channel were you watching?
God, that's what I keep you for.
KRYPTONITE!
You designed it?
I invented it, man. In my head. It's a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-Sunday super mutha computer.
Gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. We are talking unlimited power. We are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
But a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. People who will want to destroy it.
Can you do that?
No, we're just going down.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Thank ...you.
We've already met.
You know, I really wasn't expecting all this.
The picture looks blurry.
What terrific story?
Kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.
Never.  I get air-sick. You wouldn't like that.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
Okay? Goodbye.
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
I don't kiss.
We already have a super-tanker.
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
So?
That's it! The last tanker! They're all mine now! All...
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!
So far the hostages are unharmed.
Lois, what are you doing?
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Maybe I could try --
Really?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Oh Clark, no!
It's true. It's true.
Lois, I . . .
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
Hi.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Lois, I really don't see why --
Uh...home...
How would you like to take a little vacation? I mean you've earned it, you know? You deserve it.
A parka.
I like trees.
Well done, Miss Teschmacher.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
What'd he say before? He saw a girl?
What's a curl?
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
Certainly. But - Er. Oh Magnificent one, he's just one, but you are three, or four even, if you count him twice.
Oh no.  I really like it sometimes.  And if it weren't for him, I wouldn't have met you.
Wait! Don't go in! It's a trap!
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
Which one would you like to join, Luthor? Pick a hole.
And now they are willing to release the rest of the hostages?
In return for a guarantee that we will not launch an attack an them.
They make my eyes itch.
Gee, I don't think . . .
I missed you. It wasn't any fun up there with just Lois and Superman. They're so boring. Let's go do something wild!
Like me?
Regardez.  Voila Monsieur David Warfield.
No Paris?
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
Didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? Now that you're the publisher . . .
Yes, darling?
Tone down our headlines? Lacy, that's all the common man reads!
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
I think he's kind of cute.
I think there's an angle.
What's he going to say?
A toupee that flies?
Hey! He looks . . . normal.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
What I need this for?
You are . . .
Guess who? It's your old friend, Lex.
Know something? You're a workaholic. A good guy 24 hours a day. Stop and smell the roses sometime. Take up a hobby. Get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
Nobody wants war. I'd just like to keep the threat alive.
You'll be designing monuments soon, Albert! Hotels! Palaces!
It was hot, yes.
Mother...
Big night coming up?
Oh, not really. I guess I'll just watch a little TV and --  --  unless...would you be interested in dinner?
Oh.
The way you describe him doesn't really do him justice.
I'm going to bed.
La de da da...
The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an  important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
They stop for nothing.
No news is not good news. Y'know
You're not going to hit me?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
What's your name, boy?
I was thinkin' what to call him. I was thinkin' I had an uncle who was a fine man, you recall him? The Church Sexton
He'll be weightless.
I think you'll be able to remember it. I doubt you'll misquote me.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke.
I broke the man out of prison --
Please...
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
They'll soon be over.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Other clinics?  Oh sure.  Clinics, half-way houses, treatment centers, detox units...
I can help you.
I'm not sure.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
So what brings you out tonight?
That won't happen, Billy.  Mitch Stephens' case is small, compared to some of those other guys.  The way he told me, all he needs is for you to say what you saw that day, driving behind the bus.  I know it's a painful thing to do, but it'll only take a few minutes of your time.  That'll be the end of it.
Why?  You got money from Dolores' insurance with the school board.  We all did.
Nicole's coming over to look after the kids tonight.  She'll be there around six.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus.  He won't want to go.  He never does.  He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
They can look forward to that.
Because I have to.
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
What do you think?
You hate it.
No.  A little sugar though.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
So he was mean?
Do you have a room?
When?
That's great, Wendell.  That's the sort of thing I need to know.  So it doesn't come back to haunt our case later on.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Have they ever been busted?
Tell me about it.
Perfect.
DADDY!!!
You don't believe me?  You don't fucking believe me?
Yes.
I'm sorry for coming over unannounced like this, Mrs. Otto, but the Walkers said you would understand.  I know it's an awful time, but it's important that we talk.
You've been retained?
Isn't that what you want us to believe?  That we're completely defenseless?  That you know what's best?
What time in the morning was this?
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
You are?
Why were you scared?
Why were you scared?
Seventy-two miles an hour.
You believe that the bus driven by Mrs. Driscoll was going at seventy- two miles an hour at this time?
I was scared.  And there wasn't time.
Do you like the colour?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Are you sleeping?
He couldn't look at me.  But I looked at him.  Right at him.  His secret was mine now.  We used to share it.  But not anymore.  Now, I owned it completely.
Well, okay.  I'll take you about nine-thirty in the morning.  That's okay with you?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
There's talk of that.
But Charlene...
You ought to stop this nonsense, Loretta, these two dollar bets.
He's somewhere...
Did she accept?
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
Call him up and ask - he might drop dead with shock.
Blessings on thee, the both...well... Gotta run now.  See you two kids later!
Well, son, looks like you went out and bought yourself a packet of trouble...
Is it news to you?
I just checked "downtown".  Quiet everywhere tonight.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
You print them, don't you?
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think so...
Uh huh.
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
Sure, he steams her up - wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!
What's this boy got that Susie likes?
- He's got them on him.
You're sure.  Find out for me.
In his apartment -
And where was his wife?
No, an arm, he said.  I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
Go home, Sally.  It's late...
What's the matter?
It is a favor, isn't it?
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
Yes, but why?
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you...  Will you forgive me?  Have I lost you, Steve?  Have I...?
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
But I thought... aren't we changing things?  I mean... right now?  Changing the way it goes?
Please... let... the kids... go...
What chip?
We should abort.
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
Affirmative.
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
Mom?  You okay?
Ready to rock?
I know!
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
You look like handmade shit.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
It's finally over.
On all what?
Lieutenant Wills reporting to Major Arnold. Sir.
I don't know, but the British are excited about it, I know that. The rumour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, Wilhelm. And what about April 19, 1942?  The eve of Hitler's fifty- third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for Hitler, didn't you? Was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?
What telegram?
Please stop playing these games with me. Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
And I see what you mean. You nearly poked my eyes out.
I was a member of the Communist Party. I was a communist. That's what Hinkel had over me. He knew everything. He held that over me. That's how he made me co-operate.
The only thing I know is he's an anti-Semite.
Yes. A corporal. US Army. A Jew. He said he'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery.
There's a rumour... I don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der Null.
Who's he?
The Miracle Kid.
The pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
Alright, the beige one.
That's none of your business.
Yes.  Don't hurt me.
There's so much...
Stop!  I don't want to know. Hold still.  So...it was John that ordered you here?
I'm sure.
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honor and I don't want it. Any of it.
Good field-dressing.
Kyle?
Hot dogs?
A girl.  You know.
I bet you're ticklish.
And who was the enemy?
Why were the other two women killed?
I can't sleep.
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Call her.
My stock's falling.  Isn't yours? Those pennies are costing me millions.
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Are you finished?
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
Where are you going?
If there was one.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
I'll wait.
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
You deserted me.
Nice.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
What are you doing here?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
You can talk while I drive us to the police.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
I don't know.  A lot.
Who is it?
What the fuck are you... ?
Stop it!
Hi.  Didn't get a chance to say goodbye.
Big family... small?
Julliard, yeah.
Yes.
Happy Birthday, man.
They gave me a free jacket at the door.
They'll be wanting it back.
Fun?
Are you still on mediction?
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
What's this all about, Connie?
They're methodical.  They're nothing if they're not that.
Slow down, take a breath...
Really?
How did those... ?
Listen to yourself.   Why would I do anything like what you're describing?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
Robbed?
Yes.
What happened to you, Nick?  I mean, look at yourself...
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
Goddamnit, why do they do that?
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
You don't need me...
You know, these fit... perfectly.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Dinner's in the oven.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
You're not like him at all.  I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Did you worry about him?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
Your ex-wife.
Hey... !
Find out about a company called C.R.S.  Consumer Recreation Services.
These old Victorian houses are great, aren't they?
And what kind of sleeper?
I only saw Theo drive up.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
We're fucked.  We're in a haunted house and we can't get out until the morning.
Nell!
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
No.
That?  That's Hill House.
She needs help.
What do you want?
Why'd she kill herself?
And what you're wearing, that's great, too.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?
Good night, Theo.
How could he have left without his keys?
David?
There's hundreds of them.  This must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like Luke said.
I don't know what to think anymore.
I'm sorry I was mad at you, Theo.
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
Am I a thing?
It's not a knock.
Who?
We all did.
We think someone is here.
This is un-fucking professional.
You should have let me do the talking.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
Oh really?  Where you from?
Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before.
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down.  I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos.
Did Jenny know?
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
Extra muscle.  Bodyguards.
Steady on.
Do you have any friends, man?
Didn't get it.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Not embarrassed.
Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Well, don't suppose she did, really, most of her life.  On her own after her mum died.  Aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type.
Hey?
I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo.
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck.  One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
I guess you're just habitual.
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Fancy it?
Well, I'll tell you.  I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Yeah.  Shouldn't wonder.  Must've done.
All of what?
Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
Yeah.  Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
Well, time off for good behavior, you know.  I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
How much.
I don't know.
And I said so what.  You think she's any happier?
You bet.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
How we gonna get that lucky?
Hello there.
It's been five minutes and I'm packing to leave again.  I can't believe this.
At night, there were lights--we both saw them. We never told anyone, outside of our official report.
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
...You don't like the music out there?
Hello, Birdy. I thought that was very good.
Hello, Birdy.
Anyway, uh... my point is you're young. A kid really, your whole life ahead of you. But it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. Before it all washes away.
I have to do it. I can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. You're young, you don't understand.
He didn't say that.
Ah... it's nothing.
...I guess I've been all wet.
...Mm.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
...she can go up there.
...Ed Crane. Remember? Today?
Sorry, friend, I, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
Well, there it is. Writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
How ya doin', Ed?
Couldn't be better. These're boom times in retailing. We're opening another store, Big Dave's Annex, there on Garson. This is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. Matter of fact, I'm thinking of making Doris the comptroller. How're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
Please, Ed.
...What a knucklehead.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
So?
Honey...
Will anyone say they saw you there? On your way there? In there? On your was back?
...who among us is in a position to say...
Taking it seriously.
Coffee, Ed?
Ed, how're you holding up?
The point is there's a certain art to the process. The point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
What the--
I'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
They sent us to tell ya. We pulled the detail.
What'd he say?
My name is Diedrickson. County medical examiner.
Yes, sir.
Second chair.
Are you awake?... Is he awake?
It better be good.
I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast.  I think you should call it off.
Do they have to wear uniforms?
I don't want to scare people.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Behind you.
What's the combination?
That's great if you're stopping a burglar.  Not our goal here.  Are there motion detectors?
D'Agosta?  Ippolito.  Come in.
The body?
What's left of it.
How do you explain the part about Beauregard?
What happened to them?
I don't like animals.  Never have. Dog bit me when I was little.  After that I gave up on pets.  Animals are irrational.  Give me a psychotic killer any day.  If there's one thing that makes me queasy it's being part of a food chain.  My first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  It was late August.  Over ninety.  The polar bear was inside his cave.  Kids didn't know he was in there.  All they saw was the pool. They got to swimming and splashing. The noise woke up the bear.  By the time I arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  The bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. I can still hear the mother screaming --
I think I should come with you.
Go out the north exit!  There's a hallway and a false wall by the Greek vases.  Run!
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Shouldn't a drug that powerful be destroyed?
What happened?!
Dr. John Whittlesley.
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
We've met.  The Hacksaw Murders.  '89.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
It's from John.  Those two arrows were his insignia.  It's addressed to Louis Moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
Are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  Places where someone could hide?
I'm an Evolutionary Biologist.  What do you do?
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
Big as a house.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
They've got something.
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?
An invention of mine.  It's a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its DNA.  I call it the Genetic Sequence Extrapolator.
Yes.  He developed his own theory that he called the Calisto Effect. It held that evolution wasn't always gradual or driven by natural selection.  The environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  It made no sense. But he felt he had evidence that Mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
What happened?
What if Whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  Was he desperate enough to create one?
Something came up in autopsy tonight.  Imbedded in Beauregard's body we found a claw.
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
Dr. Green...
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
You are a travel agent, aren't you?  "Doris"?  Your job is to help people travel.
I thought you were in a hurry.
Cue music...
He doesn't care.
--a dead one at that.
How <i>do</i> you intend to explain his twenty- two year absence?
Amnesia.
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
A window onto the human condition?
But how do you account for the popularity of those eight hours a day when Truman sleeps?
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
That's correct.
You've never actually met Truman, yourself.  Never thought about doing a cameo--playing a veterinarian, or a priest, something like that?
Why not?
That's right.  Lauren.
Now.
Yeah?  Outta what?
I think he's alive.  I'll tell you about it later.  I'm definitely being followed.
Who?
It's hard to tell.  They look just like regular people.
I told you I can't.
This is where it started.
So what are you saying, Marlon, the whole thing has been in my head--?
Hi, honey.  Look at this.  It's a "Chef's-Mate."  Dicer, slicer and peeler in one.  Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
I've been thinking--
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
Oh, my God!
What do I do?
--we need more charcoal.
Where shall we go?  Where shall we go? Spontaneity is what it's all about. Forget Fiji.  We can't very well drive to Fiji, can we?  What about Atlantic City?
Let me out, Truman.  You're not right in the head.  You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink?  All natural.  Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
It doesn't sound insane, Truman.  I swear I see him ten times a week--in a hundred faces.  I almost hugged a perfect stranger in the salon last Thursday.
Tell her, tell her...I had to go to Fiji. I'll call her when I get there.
They're coming.  Any minute.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
They gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. But you've been unconscious since they brought you in.
Its effect on the host has changed. The virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. It's developed a way to modify the host body.
Is this Dr. Kurtzweil's residence?
What's that?
I think you're full of shit.
See this bullshit...? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.
Not according to the men in blue.
Mulder...?
Jesus, Mulder...
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Scully?
Because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. But I think this goes deeper than that.
You're... quitting?
Get dressed, Scully.
-- I'll have you back for it, Scully. Maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
What did you find?
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
You're sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
And you've never seen anything like that?
They haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they don't haul viruses in tanker trucks.
Yeah, well they may this one.
This is weird, Mulder.
Yeah...?
On whose orders?
I don't have his number.
Sit down, they're still talking to Agent Scully.
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. Agent Scully doesn't deserve this.
Mr. Mulder.
What happened to Kurtzweil?
You're lying.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
But... he sacrificed his own daughter. My sister, Samantha.
Why are you telling me this?
As your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
Find Agent Scully. Save her. Only her science can save the future.
My god...
Our vaccine may have no effect!
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
Don't bring it home in this.
Is it cold in here?
I'll come by tomorrow after work.  With dinner.
Really?  I don't work with violent cases, I work with children.  But even a kid lies.  They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true.  Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
Maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
Little boy?!  That's him!
That went well.
I heard Julia and John got married.
It doesn't matter...
What now?
Who says?
Agent Cole.
I need you to find something in the basement...
What about narcotics?
How's the patient.
After three years she remembers what the guy drove?
We proceed assuming she is.
Tell you what.  If this thing burns us, I take that heat.  I give you permission to point your finger at me and say "It was all his idea."
Jesus Christ, man, you look like hell.
Sit down.
He said he remembered me too. Seems to show he wasn't in much pain.
Dr. Winkel told me that.
H-E-Z-T...
Tell me about him.
It's just what he used to say.
I thought you wanted...
We're both in it, Harry.
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?
...anyway?
Thank you.
You can help us.
Yes.
Can you tell me whose...
You've had a bit of a shock, haven't you? You could do with a drink.
When did you see him last?
See much of him before that?
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
I can't say that I have.
"Death at the Double X Ranch" - Ra- a-nch.
...a week ago.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
Which side of the road?
Shall I go over there, sir?
Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
Striptease, sir.
It's far better thing that I do... Holly, you and I aren't heroes, the world doesn't make any heroes...
Coffee.
Dr. Winkel?
Speak English?
Already gone.
Excuse me!
Fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
That's all you meant?
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
So how many miles do you think it is?
We're ok.
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.
We leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
Francoise -
I think so too.
Incredible.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
What, do you like it here?
Disease? What disease?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Oh, really?
Why won't you talk to me?
When can I see you?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
What do you care?
Why?
Hebrew's very difficult. It would take years.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah.
No, I think you shouldn't.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
Did you see how they reacted to him?
I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason.
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that?
What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Give me a reason not to.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
You mean the <i>Times</i> guy?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
...I want you to do it on the outside, too.
No!
Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency?
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
What kids?...
The Polacks? From Sacred Heart?
Which was his room?
Which one were you aiming at?
Who even knew?
Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding.
How did you know they were Jews?
I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I...
...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish....
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Good afternoon.
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
A new world record!  That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow!  You ever been to Tahiti?
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
What was he like, when he was little?
Congratulations, Enzo.
What else is there?
Because you'd laugh.
Don't.
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Is he here?
The rules are the rules.
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
No, no!
No.
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
... Everything.
Hey!  Will you slow down!  When did you learn how to drive?
I give you this.  You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
I'm concentrating.
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
I'm still here.
And you?
Why?
You've got to tell me what happened?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
Promise me one thing.
Anything.
I brought Johana to meet you.
Where are you from, Henrietta?
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
It's his heartbeat.
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
He's in the fluoroscope now.  Listen to his heart.  Impressive, huh? The flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  It's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
It depends.  He should come up soon.  Unless he's decided to stay for the night.
Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead.
Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once.
Take Esther with you, you'll need the backup.
It's Esther.
Any sign of Santa?
I want you to talk dirty to me.
Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life.
I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong.
Esther!
Esther!
Mordechai. Do you love your mother?
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Porno? You're tellin' me that you can get porno on that thing?
Hey everybody. How's it hangin'?
Bootleg copies of the Frank Capra classic, 'It's A Wonderful Life.'
Get off of me you cripple!
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
But between the time you leave the cant ma and fall into bed in that old truck of yours, what happens, Charlie?
Where's that man?
Charlie wasn't drunk last night.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
Something black - something on its way to you 
See you tomorrow -
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Rosita  I have wondered -
Love is different for different people.
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
Yes. I want to go out and patrol the town - be everywhere at once - be sure nothing happens to anybody.
You know about animals -- their habits -- will it come back?
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
Some crazy guy.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
You're too good to me.
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to softsoap twenty editors!
	As long as my feet held out.
You're positive of that, aren't you?
Im afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brothers in trouble.
You seem surprised. Could it be you dont think that badly of him after all?  You neednt worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
No. The question now is how long its going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard...
When did you get back?
Im really sorry you were not called...
Have you finished?
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Leon hung himself.
Adonis thought your brothers bodyd be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didnt he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldnt have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. Youd have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty. Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didnt say My God!, or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then?  You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman Id stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at £15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didnt you?
Leon could still have hung himself.
You dont say.
I didnt know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Should I?
To get me killed...?
Croissants.
May I ask where youre from, Mr Lamont?
I cant believe this...  Whats coming now, eh? If I dont pay all Hells gonna break loose, is that it?
What am I to do with the packages if...
So who... Whos the man? Where is he?
Some Italian I picked up back there. Hes in the boot of the Mustang.
Im finished here and Im tired, Emily. You shouldnt be here. Now dont make it worse.
Hi...
Have we done business before?
On the bed!
...On holiday?
Must be your lucky day then. Ive got your accounts - you dont owe much tax for last year.
Good.
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose?
I came to feed your fish. I didnt know...
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one Id given you and then got back, remember? I cant find it. Do you know where it is?
Do what, Mr Lombard?
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
Im sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
The £1,000 is on account.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Lets go.
Huh... Im sure thered be lots of takers.
Is this Friedman, Martin?  Come on, scumbag. Youve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name hes using?
And while visiting our fair city you...  An Austrian?
Wheres your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Shut up! Wheres your wallet?
Can I get up now?
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leons not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
We didnt quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Yeah... But he didnt beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parents leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
Do you know Leons parents names?
Im sorry. Its just you dont look local...
Ive been away.  Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
Hows the boy doing?
And you aint neither one of those damned Mexicans who end up littering the landscape after getting ripped-off by their friendly cross- border guides, are you, mister?
Huh... I guess you aint quite ready for civilisation yet... Ill give you one more day, a meal, and then youre on your way.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesnt appeal to you...
Alors?
Fuck...
Three...
What do you think, huh?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
Moreau? Cest moi. Alors...
Whats that? A word?
What do you think?
What do you mean?
Majesty, I can't...
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
This I can do.  I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Who do they think I am?!
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
But it is what I want.
I want to stay with you...
I am ready now...
Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
Quite a few.
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Why?
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
So... here is the famous Jeanne... Savior of Orleans... terror of the English?  You look pretty ordinary to me...
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
In a village called Domremy.
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
What were you doing when the voice came?
What did it tell you?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
Thanks be to God.
Who better than a messenger from God to give answers to your questions?
It's true.  There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
But... her army's so small now...
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
... and what... what did he say?
Ah, Jeanne... come here...!  This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
Your majesty, I really think you...
Is it long and hanging down?
Well.  I'd love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, I felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till Alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
Well...?  Shall we go?
So you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
I... submit to Our Lord.
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
No!
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
Jeanne, if you don't mind... I'll stay standing... this armor... it's a nightmare to get back up...
How many did he give you?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
I might ask you the same question.
I... I never lied!
That's too easy.  One minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
Why were you yelling like that?!
What do you mean, they won't come?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
Beautiful.
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
I've always loved your playing, Mr. Szpilman.
Dorota!
Sit.
I need help.
I've been in hiding. I need somewhere to stay.
Let me see this.
It's not going to be very comfortable.
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
The Gestapo found our weapons. They've arrested Janina and Andrzej. They're bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
Can you help us?
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
Someone's got to do it, Henryk.
What d'you mean, take the table away?
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
I know.
It's not funny.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
What are you reading?
Ah, here. Today's news from the other side.
Wladek! How are you?
Dirty pig!
You're a dirty pig!
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
Out of Warsaw.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
What's happening?
Ohhh I've never been there. 
T-w~e-l-v~e.
No, words. You have never heard words?
No, but her words are in my head.  I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
What did she say?
Play a gig.
Mama.
Nobody.  I just know what kinda women he likes.  I'm gonna check all the joyhouses till I find him.
What do we do?
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
He was a con man, wasn't he?
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
I'm busy, Floyd.
It's important.  We had a little trouble in Chicago today.  One of our runners got hit for 12 grand.
Which one?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
Yes sir.
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.
We bought ya a tap into Moe Anenberg's wire.  He's got eyes at every track in the country.  You'll get race results, odds, scratches, pole positions, everything; and just as fast as Western Union gets 'em.
You sober?
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I picked something up on the way.
We'll get by without 'em.
This isn't like playin' winos on the street.  You gotta do more than outrun the guy.
Then you'll do it?
No.
Nothin'.  I told ya everything there is.
All we need is a couple days, Henry. A couple days and we'll get Lonnegan down and stomp on 'em.
What's the matter, kid?  You're not sayin' much.
Just a little nervous, that's all.
Then why you doin' it?
The wire is ten years outa date.
Looks like he's sulking.
You in?
She coulda killed me last night.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
It'll only take 20 minutes or so. You can pick it up at the window down the hall.
But what about all these other people?
Then why the rat?
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
I'm in.
You want a drink or something?
Can't do it.  There're telegraph inspectors all over the place.  I got 750 grand coming in from the coast, and I'm not gonna blow it for a lousy 14 gees.  We'll get somebody else to do our betting.
Yes.  He admitted it.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
Nothing.
Mind if I look around?
Go!
Give it to me.
No.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
She fell down.
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Yes, she would.
Where are you going?
How's your brother?
Well, I've got my alibi.  I was at the Public Library.  Where were you?
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
No.
You've been there?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
I haven't got that far yet.  But I don't think that everything points to Wynant.  What about the alibis?
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
Yes.  But we figured it was just blackmail...
Oh, then you did hear from him?
There are a few things we want to check up on.
No.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Good morning --
Do you think that Wynant did it?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
Want to take a poke at him?
I can't remember offhand, Lieutenant.  Maybe I was over at Charlie's shooting pool. Maybe I was here.  She'd remember.
I'll get some.
Chris!
I don't like him.
Go ahead!
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Oh, please, Nick.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
You don't say --
You know as much about it as I do. I haven't seen him in three months.
My wife.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I gotta talk to you.  I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
Why tell me?
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
I'd like to see you work.
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
There's one coming.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Who's that?
Is that another Christmas present?
Yes.
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
Let's see.  Where's it from?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Your guess is as good as mine.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Nick!
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea.  Want to see me take him?
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
That's what Mr. Wynant said to me. If she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
I just wanted to tell you...
Home!
What's it say?
They shouldn't have been here.
Not much chance of that.  Jaeger's an idiot.
I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
What am I supposed to do?
I don't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins.  Wes!?  We'll send the gold up, then me and Jaeger'll climb back.
Maybe we should split it up now.
You got no reason to do that!
You said he was a deserter.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it...
No navicom.  A lot of good you are now, Epps.
You disappoint me, Epps.  Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy.  I had respect for you.
I have to answer him.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
What!?  What!?
You're such a pussy, you know that? How'd you get in the army?
You're getting gold, and you're going to blow it on wheels?
Take the binoculars.
I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
What!?
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
We're not going to do anything.
A whole lot of nothing.
They'll ask questions; want to know why we were out here.
We'll lie.
And you; you've got it all together.
Really, I'm not.  Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis?  That's all it was was talk.  I was scared out of my mind to go to war. I still haven't gotten over stepping on that land mine.
You still got a map on you?
I don't want to die.
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
We've got to keep moving while there's still light.
Well, we should identify ourselves.
And then what?
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
Australia.
Well, this is it.  We get the car, find some Americans.  We find Americans we'll be all right.
He's not slowing.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
Yeah.  So?
What!?
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
I thought we were dead.
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Is there anything you do know?
Funny you should say that while we're out looking for gold.
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
So we'll take him with us.  At least 'til we get back to the Hummer.
We had to take shelter in the checkpoint. Jesus, Wes, I killed the Iraqis in there.
Correct.  Origin?
A sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
Control ON.
Vocasity
What's this?  Why did you change it?
I haven't done anything.
I've never been under the table before.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
What are you doing here?  Is anything wrong?
What are you doing?
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me.  You'll report me for drug evasion.
It's all right now, shhhh it's all right.
They're watching us now.
What?
I won't have another mate like ONA.  You rate very high in sanitation.  I've checked.  In fact, I am surprised that you were ever matched with LUH.  Her ratings are very erratic - you know what I mean.  We'll be happy.
I'm leaving.
What are you doing here?
...and you're not lost now?
Must be an expressway.... You don't have to stay here, you know....
Would you like part of this? ....It's not much.
That's not it.
What do you want?
Yes.
You are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  Check cybernetic manual F-45.  If you do no have an F-45, you are in violation.  This is a double A restricted precinct. Remain where you are.  Authorities will arrive shortly.
One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. Name's Carl Taylor. Long record of arson, assault, the works. The other print - we got nothing from our data base or the FBI or CIA... still waiting for Interpol.
Aren't you on suspension?
Anything else I should know?
Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
How long are we going to stay?
I know. I was working a drug ring, deep cover. Played the part too well. When they pulled me out, I wasn't a cop anymore. My fiance had dumped me. Next thing I knew, I was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. He promised Captain Winters he'd look out for me.
Where you guys at?
Good, now the other side.
Too easy. There's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
What... ?
You got it.
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
Mike. No thanks, I'm fine.
Pooch, can you move it?
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
Device.
I'll do it.
I know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or I'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
Glass, sorry about Pooch, he was a good man. We don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
Reilly, what's happening? Reilly! Reilly! Do not engage. We're five minutes-
So you lost a handbag, madame?
Yes.
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
No!
Why did you let this man in, M'sieu Filiba?
No ...  Have <u>you</u> ever been in Vienna?
Ogilvie and Oglethorpe.
Just dull.
Funny--the first time I saw him I thought he was a doctor!
I would start with cocktails.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
Um-hum!
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
I've got to see you.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
Monescu.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
Why should you?
I like you, Baron.
Monescu!
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Seven and nine!
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Ah!
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Filiba ...
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
By the way, how is your German?
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
Yes...?
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
That's too dark.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
Like that!
And you're going to fall for them.
So you think you can get me?
I'm crazy about you!
Mariette!
Adolph J. Giron.
Giron...!
Has Mademoiselle Gautier gone?
Oh, that's too bad. You see, I wanted her to do something.  Well, I guess I'll have to do it myself.
For all the really important things--
Yes, madame?
I think you'd better go.
Then why did you do it?
Didn't you take it with you?
Water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
She's not on the starboard side either.
You know I don't like that, Rose.
I was tired.
This should be amusing.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
We got room for lots more. I say we go back.
Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
So don't marry him.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
And these were drawn from life?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
A whole ten cents?!
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
A mistake?
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
You're right. Only you can do that.
Where to, Miss?
It's bad.
You have to go for help.
I promise.
It's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
I'm sorry.
Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Anya!
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
--that's what we call double-a grade lumber, ma'am; You don't find a knot in a thousand feet.
Lifted it out of a guy's cabin last night.
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Very much--
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Good-by!
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
You mean that?
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
How're the tips?
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it.  Funny--her name's not on the passenger list. 
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
About sixteen hundred.
Partners, ain't we?
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
Here you are, sir. 
"Will be back in four weeks"--  --that saves you eighty cents right there!
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
Well, there's no use in sending it.  See that--I saved you seven twenty!
What?
Not yet.  Say, where is this boat headed for?
Let me see now--Don't tell me--  You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
H'mm--<U>Dear</U> Atlantic--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
Thanks to me.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
Not because of Ned.
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
No!
I sincerely hope so--
What!--are you crazy?
Nothin'.
I saw him take the bracelet out of that shoe.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Isn't that a daisy?
Just pick up your money and go. Sick of listening to you simper.
Yes, very.  And very married.
What'd the Messican mean, a sick Horse's gonna get us?  Didn't make No sense.
He was quoting the bible, Revelations: "Behold a pale horse And the one that sat on him was Death and Hell followed with him."
I'm retired.
Come on, you...
Feel bad about ol' Fred.  Just Can't hold back when I'm feelin' Woolly.  Still, feel kinda bad. But now we're square.  Anyway no Use for holdin' a grudge.  I Deserved a rap in the head.
They were all gonna jump me back There.  What ever happened to one Against one?
This brand.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
But wait, you don't understand-
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Ecentus stultorum magister.
That's just my game.
Here, Doc.
What's that mean, Doc?  You know I Don't understand when you talk up High like that.  You mean you Don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
Not exactly...
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Doc!  How the hell are you?
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
Very instructive
Satisfied?
Maybe I ought to go out there.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
What?
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
You're a little touchy about it.
Just answer.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
No, no, get away, get away from me...
I have to go.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Come up to the fire, honey.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
I need it.
'Least you admit it.
But this time they'll be ready.
What'd you do that for?
There they are.  No herd though.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Talked it over.  We decided we Don't need the money.  Took out 13 Dollars each, though.  Federal Posseman's fee.  That all right?
Well that's your problem.  Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
They're carrying guns in town.
Getting late.  Guess I'll turn in.
What about all these saloons?
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
A piece of advice, Mr. Bond: Don't screw with a man who buys ink by the ton.  It's deadlier than uranium.
Sir Elliot.
Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men...  Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her.
...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites.
They're merely tools to disseminate information.
Briefly.
...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies.
I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
I'm sure she is, James. But I'm afraid you'll have to 'kiss off' the rest of your lessons this afternoon.
Moneypenny... Here I was, finally getting a feel for a new tongue -
- We all want what we can't have?
Do I have to dial '9' to get out?
Shhhhh...
Paris -
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
Gone fishing.
Saunders, I've lit cigarettes -
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
That's reassuring.
Where to now, Jimbo?
Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me.
Nice to run into you again.
I hope you'll be gentle.
What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.'
Put your back to the railing. Sit up on it.
Sometimes you just have to -
If you think we're going to have some kind of 'life affirming' romance here just because we cheated death, let me be clear:  We're going to have it where I want, and when I want.
I was just getting to the interesting part!
We've already done the interesting part. Do you forget?
Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here.
...Well! I do believe this requires further investigation!
That was too close.
Yes. Shall we kill them?
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
When are you boys going to fix that roof?
Soon as I rest a bit.  I meant as soon as we are back to normal again, anytime.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
This is not a good time to take chances. Your best friend, Robert, an accountant, lost his home and is out on the street. We see him from time to time. He comes down to church for a free meal.
I told her I would if she would give me time.
You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son, it is always you, so you fix the roof.
I'll drive her to the hospital.
I'm cold. I need to get out into the sunlight.
Do you think you won?
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
I need to get my suitcase out of the garage.
You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
You must have been really sick.
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
Why didn't you catch a plane?
What could have caused this? I just changed this damn thing.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
You must have done something to her.
You invited me.
Miss Clara's boy, Emory, to start with. The Johnson's Hocker was another one...
Some people grow up and change their ways.
I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
Not you mustn't touch. Your mama might not like you handling knives.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Counting the gray hairs in your head.
I'm sorry he got those birds.
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
You can bring ONE toy...
Can I help pump the gas?
Where was the last place you left him?
Yes.  They're Andy's toys.
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Don't even think about it, cowboy!
I could have stopped him.
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
Don't tell me what to do!
No, Woody, for the first time I am thinking clearly.  You were right all along.  I'm not a Space Ranger.  I'm just a toy.  A stupid little insignificant toy.
Hold on, Woody!
Eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
I don't know!
I'll have to perform one of my...operations!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
Will you quit moving around?!
A lunchbox?!
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!
ROOAAAARR!!!
Come in, Mother Bird, this is Alpha Bravo.
W-w-w-we?
Hey, Slinky?
I'm red this time.
Woody?!
Boy, am I glad to see you guys!
I can't hold on much longer!
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Everything is gone, now.
I'm Melanie.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
What?  What is it?
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
Have you gone crazy?  You are not Carl.  You aren't as good as Carl.  They are moving the trial to a high security location.  The press has gone berserk.  The jury will be influenced.  Stay out of things. Let us try to win the case.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
Carl, that's insane.
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Explain to me how you could think that I shouldn't know about this. Explain to me how this wouldn't be relevant to me.  As a parent.
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
Should we bring the police into this?
Is this bad for him?
I don't know.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.
You can't make me.
Do you work?
I volunteer.  I read to blind people. One day a week for two hours.
Private?
What's that mean?
Are you getting this on tape?
What do you think she wants?
Depends on the state.
I'll put this in the back.
Yes.
You may speak.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
So you pay off our customs officials?
I want to know who is responsible for this treatment.
Bring this man a change of good clothes.  Has he eaten?
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
It's no problem.  I was just with everybody we work with.
You should feel good about this.
One question.  How did you find about this?
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
It could mean that, yes.
It's possible.
My work keeps me young.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
This is a business.  Get the fuck outta here.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
I don't know, maybe we missed her.
You've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel.
Hello.
I'll get there as soon as I can.
What do you mean?
Mapping the fucking pig genome. We'll call your dad, he's a neurosurgeon --
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
I'd fucking kill you.
What's your name?
It's where I live.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Yes.
No.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What happened?
Well, Mr. Renton, I see that you attended the Royal Edinburgh College.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Oh, really?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Mr. Murphy, do you mean that you lied on your application?
I'd really rather take care of it myself.
No.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
Cheers.
Another dab?
Running time?
Lewis Gilbert.
Screenwriter?
God, you're sick.
Cut it out.
Fuck you.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
How much?
Well, it's up to you.
Yeah, well, it surely worked for him.
Your favourite dish.
Excellent.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Sure.
Such as?
There.
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
Plotting our new course.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
Oh, please.
Your orders are to proceed to Nimbus III, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. Above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
No, but you can bet they will.
Don't you worry, Captain. We'll beat those Klingon devils even if I have to get out and push.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Paradise City, can you boost your power? We're barely receiving transmission.
And that is?
Exactly 15.5 seconds.
You must allow us to act.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
This is a new brig, Captain. It is escape-proof.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
Spock! My only concern is getting the ship back. When that's done and Sybok is in here then you can debate Sha Ka Ree until you're green in the face. Until then, you're either with me or you're not.
No! No reply. Remain on course.
The ship needs its Captain.
What have I done?



Easy, easy,  easy, Scotty. Easy. You're back with us.
I hide no pain.
"Embezzling" is such an ugly word, Mister Bailey...  No, actually I'm trying to get a legal brief together.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Okay, okay...
Not disintegrating, Alan -- digitizing. While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object, the computer maps out a holographic model of it. The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam. Then the computer reads the model back out, the molecules go back into place, and...  voila.
That all you can say?
Yes.  It felt like Flynn.
I would if I could find it. it's stashed somewhere off in the system ... out of my range. Meanwhile...
Ed, all I'm saying is - if our own people can't get access to their programs ... you know how frustrating it is, when you're working on a piece of research -
Dumont!
No big deal. I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine... I mean, I did write the program for it.
How about you?
Boy the view from up here... you know the territory?
The MCP blasted it... There are very few domains left with any power at all.
Yeah, yeah -- that's great.
How 'bout yourself?
You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old.
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games... cheap?
We have to get off this beam!
Nice...
So I guess you didn't get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
I'm done.
You seem fine now.
Okay, Dad.
How was school today?
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Dad, how come you know the words?
Yes.
They call him "The Sand Spider".				*
What's this for?
What a team.  See you at eight.
Harry Tasker.  One zero zero two four.
You better watch it.  She might file on you for sexual harassment.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
What's the plan?
Son of a bitch!
Abu Kaleem Malik.
She's still at my house.						*
Goddamnit, Harry.  This is our butts.  So your life is in the toilet.  So your wife is banging a used car salesman.  Sure it's humiliating.  But be a man here--
She's lying.
We're dead, right?  So... where'd you put the transmitter?
Is this a common thing for you? Cheating?
Ten, Mr. Gibson.
Yes sir.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
This is Persian, if I'm not mistaken.
I've always been a collector at heart.  When I see something I want, I have to have it.
Yes.
It's the big client in Japan, and it's the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
So, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  Did is work out okay?
How long have you been a member of his faction?
Not because you were attracted to him?
You weren't attracted to him at all?
What were you doing there?
What is it?
What're we talking about here? Pussy, right?
Hello?
Yes.
Not yet.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
I didn't get any chicken.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Tell him we gotta go.
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
Want some Goobers?
Great movie. Action-packed!
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
What time is it?
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Burt Reynolds.
Four hundred bucks.
What's that?
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
What did he do to Arlene?
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
What?
I do.
Was it him or you?
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Yeah.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Where the fuck is that bitch?
You got it.
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Good for you.
You're really in love, aren't you?
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
What's this acting class guy's name?
Elliot.
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
No. Not yet.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt.  Where's a good chicken place around here?
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
Now I can't be sure of how much of what he told you. So in the chance you're in the dark about some of this, let me shed some light. That whore your boy hangs around with, her pimp is an associate of mine, and I don't just mean pimpin', in other affairs he works for me in a courier capacity. Well, apparently, that dirty little whore found out when we're gonna do some business, 'cause your son, the cowboy and his flame, came in the room blastin' and didn't stop till they were pretty sure everybody was dead.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
I don't know. He just appeared as magic.
That was a good fuckin' movie.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts  cryin', and then it was all over -
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
You do more than try.
How's he supposed to see the wire?
Looky here, you want the bitches to really fly high, make your rocks with Cherry Seven-Up.
No.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
Do you know where we can find him?
He's at the Beverly Wilshire.
No.
Women will want to get to know you...
That the virus was taken from Philadelphia to San Francisco, then to New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking.
I need to go now.
What's wonderful about the air, James?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
I have the...strangest feeling I've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. Were you ever...?
It's just a shot to calm you.
Cole!  James Cole!  You escaped from a locked room six years ago.
Yes, I remember.  Why do you want to go to Philadelphia?
My father told me that.  "Never cry wolf."  Then people won't believe you if...something really happens.
"If something really happens"...like what, James?
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
I thought you didn't know how to drive.
Nobody is going to wipe out the human race.  Not you or Jeffrey or anybody else.  You've created something in your mind, James -- a substitute reality. In order to avoid something you don't want to face.
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
We're avoiding the police until I can....talk to you.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
Well, you look pretty different, too.
What'd they give you?  Thorazine?  How much?  Learn your drugs -- know your doses.
Wiping cut the human race!  That's a great idea!  But it's more of a long term thing -- right now we have to focus on more immediate goals.  I didn't say a word about "you know what".
It's private.
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
We need to talk.  Come on.  Upstairs.  I am a new person!  I'm completely adjusted.  Witness the tux.  It's Armani.  Who chattered?  Goines?  Weller?
Remember?  We were in the dayroom, watching TV, and you were all upset about the...desecration of the planet. And you said to me, "Wouldn't it be great if there was a germ or a virus that could wipe out mankind and leave the plants and animals just as they are?"  You do remember that, don't you?
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
Hey, man...
You're insane, Jeffrey.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
James Cole.  That's everything we got.  None of the James Coles on the computer match him. No license, no prints, no warrants.  Nothing. You want me to go in with you?
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
What do you want for free?
You sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
That's 'cause I've done a lot of living.
You're a hell of a pessimist, old man.
We're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
It is not.
You Harlin?
Will he be back soon?
You own this place?
Somewhere else?  Mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  How you planning on getting it there? You gonna push this heap yourself?
Look, I just want to pick up my car.
She's all yours. Put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
What's that got to do with the radiator hose?
Then you're only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  Now why don't you just take your Visa Express Silver Card, call Karl Malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
No charge.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
No, we ain't got no Kirin.  We got Miller.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
Lord!  Put the baby in the icebox. Killed the poor thing.
I could do that.  'Course we'd have to go back into town.  There'd be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  A whole crowd of witnesses.  That wouldn't be too pretty, now would it?
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
They look nice.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
Yes, I have.
Where you coming from?
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
My face tell you all that?
All right, Grace.  No more games.
Still playing?
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
How far is it to California?
Beautiful.  Beautiful beaches.  Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
Jake.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
John?  John where are you going?
I mean it, Grace.  I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
Is that what changed your mind?  The money?
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
It doesn't matter.  He was there and he let it happen.  He can't take us in.
What?
I shot him.
I know.  He was to take the fucking money.
You're tense.  What are you all uptight about?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
But I want to say with you,
John!
Are you all right?
It's . . . it's locked.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
What happened to your hand?
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life.  Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit. Do you know why?  Because you're a man without scruples.
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Nice office you've got.
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
Just to get out of here?  That doesn't seem much for a murder.
Make it twenty.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .
Came close this time and it scares you.
Trouble with the car again?
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I'm curious about something.  I'm wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
I asked you a question.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
I wasn't doing anything.
They're not very imaginative?
Christ, I don't believe this.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
Just step from the car.  Nice and slow.
Eh?
No police.
You want something?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.
Hell no!
What do you want for free?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
Christ, I don't believe this!
You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
What the fuck do you want?
Oh? Darrell taking good care of you?
California...
Hey!
You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars.
I'm not rambling.
You're talking like a madman.
How much could you get?
Wait a minute.  Just listen to me...
You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
So?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
What the hell happened to my car?
Hundred-fifty.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
Listen, Darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as I get where I'm going I swear I'll--
Two-hundred.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
Look, Harlin.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
Got any cold soda?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.
I got it.
I just drove in this morning.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
My face tell you all that?
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Stop it.
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
I thought you couldn't get your car.
I can't see it.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.
Thank you. Thank you. I...I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.
Can you make it back up?
Yeah, if you could send it care of...
What'd you say to me!
You got a beer?
My lord, that little baby of yours Virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
Morning Grace.
I know.  I was here when your apprentice was helping you.  Remember?
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Whoa, what kind of accent you got there? You one of them Russians?
What does that mean?
Like what?
Quick.
He's doing well today.
Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
No Jeremy.
How much did you take off?
Against a window.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
A whippin'? That's all they get? After what they done?
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Little Bill come out of Kansas an' Texas, boys. He worked them tough towns.
You want... a free one.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
What's all that wood?
Yup.
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Good example! Good example of what I'd like to know? He didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
About what?
Bein' my partner. I'm headin' North up around the Niobrara in Nebraska. Gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
Shit!
Say, Bill...
That was... the first one.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
Eleven.
Easy, huh? Hell, I don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  Bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... I could see shootin' 'em...
Cut up a woman. Cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, I guess.
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.
You was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
Shit.
No.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Huh? Uh... yeah.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
You want the Spencer, Bill? 
Me an' the Kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. Then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head South together.
We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
He ain't as tough as you, Kid.
We're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
We done that stuff.
He's gonna die, ain't he?
You mean, am I gonna help you kill them cowboys?
Jack. What are you doing here?
They just said they wanted time.
Give me some credit. I got you this far, let's go to the grand jury. This is never going to stop if we -
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
You heard right.
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
I was out of line.
How are they going to do it?
McManus wants to go in shooting. I said no way.
Maybe more.
What is it Keaton?
Let's say for example -
You set up the line-up.
Take your time. Enjoy L.A.
A little of both.
What do you mean I can't see him?
Someplace else, then.
His name was Arturo Marquez. A petty smuggler out of Argentina. He was arrested in New York last year for trafficking. He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach. They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again. Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
I don't know about that.
You think I don't know you held out on the D.A.? What did you leave out of that testimony? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes.
Kobayashi.
Came from Redfoot.
Then what?
TRY TO REEF LYING TO ME NOW. I KNOW EVERYTHING .
I don't understand what you're saying. I saw Keaton get shot, I swear to you.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
He wanted me to live.
Why lie about everything else, then?
You're not safe on your own.
I'm not bait. No way. I post today.
You posted twenty minutes ago. Captain Leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
Mr. Abraham...
He was accused of jury tampering.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
No -- we don't want this case in court.
It's a generous offer, Mr. Galvin... ...nothing can make the woman well...but we try to compensate...to make a gesture...
And no one will know the truth.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
It looks that way.
What does it mean?
`Code Blue,' what does that mean...?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
That's right.
And what did your team do...
...to get her heartbeat back...?
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
...of Anesthesiology?
In fact, you've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury. You've just sworn to that.  Isn't that right?
Yes.
...sworn before God you would tell the truth?
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
Please sit down.  I told your wife. I'm sorry that we have to meet out here.  I've got a case coming in two days in the  Superior Court and my office is a mess of papers.
... that's all right.
I'm going to win this case...Mist...Mr. Doneghy...I'm going to the Jury with a solid case, a famous doctor as an expert witness, and I'm going to win eight hundred thousand dollars.
If I could accept the offer right now, I would.  They took it back.
They gave her the wrong anesthetic.
...that's what the sister said. The chart said she ate nine hours prior to...
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
Dr. Thompson...?
That's what I'd planned to...
These people play very rough. They don't want to lose this case. There's a lot of pressure they can bring to bear, I...
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
Yes.
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
Well, well, when can we meet again. I'd like to get a deposition..
I'll just take a minute.  Deborah Ann Kaye.  You know what I'm talking about.  The case is going to trial. Our chief witness is a Dr. David Gruber, you know who he is?
Nothing happened.
That happens.
Is the Plaintiff ready?
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Hello, I'm calling from...
Yes.  Price...
What Hotel are you staying at?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
And are they going to get it?
I've got to work.
And what makes you so tough?
It's over!
What is that to you...?
Joe...  Joe...
No.
Thank you.
One lousy letter eighteen months ago. . . .I try to throw a fuckin' case your way ...
What do you want?
You -- Listen:  you said to me, `if not now, when...'
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
Been a long time, huh...?
I'm getting it back.  Don't worry about me, Mick.  I'm fine.  D'you find the obstetric nurse?
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
She's workin' the late shift at the Hospital.  She's at home now, I'm going over there to talk to...
I'm swell.
The Doctors.
She didn't do anything.  She took the patient's history and signed the charts.  'K.C.'  'Kathy Costello...'
...four years ago...
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
She did?
Hi.
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
What did she say?
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.
Well, well, well.  Huh?
Yes.
It is hard to say. Six months, at least. Perhaps a year. It depends to a certain extent on him.
How long have you been back?
Would you like a drink now?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
But you knew about this.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
Your name. And --
It's a place to live, that's all.
I told you! Right here!
Tomorrow night? Well --
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
I like that one.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
The color of your hair...
Ah, no!
Where shall we go for dinner?
Scottie!
Where are you going?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
Your accident...
What are you going to do?
Where were you?
Why?
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
I... didn't know where you lived.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Some people prefer it.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Would you like some coffee?
Meet again, sometime.
Do you know where you're going?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
No birds live here.
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
Where?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
Why?
Yes... you run this hotel.
Valdes. Miss Valdes.  It's Spanish, you know.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
Would you please go and look?
I've never run across one like that.
Uh-huh!
Pop Leibel.
For what?
Did you need it?
What was this desperate urge to see me?
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
Can we have it by tonight?
Well, if it's absolutely necessary...
You're an asshole Adam.
I was just playing...we were playing just playing around.
You're not a team player.
The hell I don't.
Go home!
One idea that if you had fucking listened to, you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars.
What are you talking about?
We check out the area and wait for a time when it's clear.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
You got us into this mess.
Lighten up Adam. Show some character.
Honey, go in there and get some Starbursts.
Doing the bachelor party thing?
Sin City. Devil's Playground. The Black Bitch. All day every day.  Where's Tina?
That's right.
What's goosed?
All right people. New plan. Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan.
He's cracked up.
What?
And what does that mean?  Are you insane?!  You think I would hurt Lois?! She's the mother of those kids! What is wrong with you?
I don't know...
Good deal. Lois just wants to hear it from Micheal.
Hear what?
I'm getting really tired of your bullshit.
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Not true.
They have a president. A Benjamin Yahoo something.
What's your point?
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
The need to know is clear. What did Adam tell Lois? That's the name of the game. What did Adam tell Lois? What does Lois know?
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Stop it!
Yea...It's great...seems like...I don't know you've got all the important stuff in there.
Sent it.
Yes.
What else have you forgot?
How could I know what else I forgot?
Because you wanted to. You wanted this to be your wedding not your parent's.
Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
I'm not. What's the problem?
So what do we do?
Go down to the seat place and straighten this out.
Do you love me?
Well, the night is young. Did you straighten out the chair situation?
Nesting?
What!
Yeah baby. Everything's great.
Cry for Boom Boom. It's okay.
Liz we've got to cancel, we have to put it off.
You killed a prostitute.
Like how?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
He's your brother.
I have no idea.
Where's Boyd?
I guess.
There.
That's a good one.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
No, the children sleep with me.
Two.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
How did you know about that?
Yes, it is.
Wasn't that cowardice?
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Let me pass!
You must listen to me before you go.
How much is that?
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
He was asking for it.
Ramona! Ramona!
I don't know, sir.
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.
She's left.
I'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! You mustn't play under this tree.
I'm only good at making people laugh.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
If you try to run, I'll hunt you down and kill you myself.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for?
Before you, nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him. Hell, nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first.  New scar  you making it okay in there?
She wasn't part of the deal, Cox.
Officers in Toluca Lake just found an affluent couple...completely gutted.  So were the first two cops to arrive on scene.
Any sign of Lindenmeyer?
Think you can do it?
Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field, remember?
The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
I'm still making adjustments...
Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
She's some of your finest work, Daryl.
Help me get out of here.
A little less than yesterday.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Go to hell.
What happened when he was 17?
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
... here on earth to create havoc and terror. I am War, I am death. I am destruction. David Berkowitz, 1977.
I am impressed.
You should practice lying more often. You're awful at it.  Where to?
What the hell's going on?!
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
I pose an unacceptable danger to the public, remember?
Find out anything?
Lindenmeyer?
Where's John?
Now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? I mean, just because I'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.
DEAD! YOU HEAR ME?
I wouldn't pull the trigger if I were you
Well, darlin' <u>I</u> ain't your confessor.  Tell him you've got some info on the President's sex scandal, it's on your conscience, believe me, he'll drop what he's doing.  Okay;  <u>Now</u>:  Folks, folks, folks, this is a shitty business, and it needs no Ghost Come From the Grave to tell us that.  But in Six Days, Lord willing n'Jesus Tarries, I am going to take you beauties into the second term. .....wait til you hear the speech tonight.  The 3-0-3 Speech... where's the Fad King, by the way...
When you...  What?  I'm busy.
Alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
Come on.
Naa, fuck this, this is nothing.  Oh, Lord -- this just got <u>Big</u>.  I see it -- <u>Big</u> -- Big for <u>you</u> and big for <u>me</u>.
What are you talking about?
You're not <u>thinking</u> right, Pal...
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
Tell, tell, tell me again.
....we landing?
We aren't going to have a war.  We're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
...but...
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
What did Albania ever do to us?
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
And carrying.  The National Flower of Albania, something..... Now Is it some Festival?  Some <u>Harvest</u> Festival, something...
Stanley Moss, Ladeesngennlmen... And she says...
How long you been up, you need a nap.
Oh, God...
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
"...where's my pill..."
ON SCHUMANN, WHO HAS CONE TO THE BACK OF THE COUNTER, AND IS EMPTYING THE CANNISTERS.
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
Hello...?
Course there's a war.  I'm watching it on Television.
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
Why do people go to war?
...why?
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
...Yoha, Yoha... Yoha.  <i>Why</i> Albania?
Because.
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
What?
I saw it on TV.
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
They got him standing by.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Of what?
I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
He's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
I think we were experiencing a Little Technical Difficulty.
What he went through in <u>Albania</u>...
They'll be here in ten minutes.
A proud tradition.
It's too clean.
Why can't it be a ribbon?
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
Jim Belushi...?
A beret.
Cause you can crush it and put it in your pocket.
Long's you git me back for the beans...
...gimme some help...
Fox says Bluestar just hit 23. What do you want him to do?
Oh really.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
... That's what you told us to say.
I don't think you're being fair, sir. You assigned me this guy, and you know he's got a history...
Buddy, buddy, buddy; little trouble, huh, today.
Buddy, buddy, some buddy; why didn't you tell me to buy Bluestar.
Hey you hear the news. I just got a job at a new firm: "Dewey, Cheat 'em and Howe." Yuk yuk.
Sell?
... looks like you grown another inch... but you don't look so hot, getting bags under your eyes, starting to look old like me.
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
... it adds up Buddy, 300 here, 200 there. Your brother never...  ...well, I always said money is something you need in case you don't die tomorrow...
That's great Dad.
Whatever night you like.
I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them!
What are you doing here?
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
So, where are we going?
Want some?  Gordon tells me you're a very talented broker. What do you like?
Okay.
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
He never told me...
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Believe me, Buddy, I was gonna discuss this with you at the right time. Look, why don't you calm down and come to the apartment for dinner tonight. Bring Darien...
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Oh really?  Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
The conference, oh yeah. Fine. We reached an agreement and decided to divide up the world between us.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than $100,000. Curtains alone...
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
You really mean that?  What'd he promise you? To take you public? I guess without Gordon's money and seal of approval, I'm not such a hot investment anymore. You're just the best money can buy, Darien...
How you doing Buddy?
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
You're on a roll kiddo. Enjoy it while it lasts -- 'cause it never does.
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
Cards are on the table. What do you think?
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Businessman?
But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Anybody want another drink?
Thank you Jenkins
Hello?
Guys, if I'm going to play the hero at least give me a little room.
Must be what we came for. The four stand slowly and enter through the doors, which close behind them.  They begin walking around  the WAXWORKS, which appear gruesome. The first they spy is of a high school student with a letter  jacket on the verge of being hacked with an axe by and angry woodsman.  They give each other looks of  disgust and continue on.  The next is of a Frankenstein-esque creature carrying a woman in its arms.  The  four are now roaming around the WAXWORKS individually, with TONY encountering what appears to be  a tribal INDIAN pointing a knife towards a victim.  MARK walks past a circus cart with some sort of werebeast inside, and then continues on to a staircase exhibit with a dead woman at the base of it.  On the  staircase is a zombie-fied creature.  We see CHINA walking on the other side of a bandage wrapped man  pumping gasoline into a woman's mouth.  Finally, we see TONY walking up to a cottage room display.
No thank you sir we're fine.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
They're all human beings
Yes?
I'll come back all the time.
No, he wouldn't.
Someone crying.  A girl.  I thought I was crazy.
I didn't want to come.
Then why did you?
Try to communicate with her somehow.
You think you influenced her?
Of course.  You must be so proud.
At the party.
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
Um...yes.
I've seen you.  From the window.
Would you like some iced tea?
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
No.  No, I don't.
You look a little old for a student.
Full scholarships.  Princeton too.  She wanted to stay close.
Y'hear anything you'll let me know?
You are?
It's niiice.
Beautiful thing, alimony.  Lose a husband, get a car.  Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Mrs. Feur.  She's alive.  I met her. She's really sweet.
But Claire--
Okay.  Okay.
If she was dangerous before--
I guess not.
Claire, I have to show up for the--
It's just she's been the focus for a while.
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
Of what?
Why?
Claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
I've got the conference next week.  I want you to feel safe.
He killed her.
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Who did?  Mrs. Feur?
...Don't get all...
Claire, she's been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  If you weren't thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
Who did?
But then you've been so much better...
Yep.
...I'm positive this time...
You should have tried harder.
She's gone.
Huh.
Don't think so.
:What, you're doing Darcy? Since when?
Michael, Rowan should -
What have the witches always asked of you...?
on't know what else to do.  Maybe I just don't belong in her life.  well - I'm already out of her life.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
Down here. darling, we figure: If you're taking a trip to God knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
In certain cases, hell is the operative word.
You babbling that nonsense - now...? This is a wedding.
Gifford Mayfair - I'll cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
My...mother...?
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Better than most, I suppose.
Just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
You - are - a - murderer.
Go back, MICHAEL... Go Back
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
Massive subdural hamatoma.  We have to evacuat it - right now.
Explain this to me --- violated...?
And now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
I do not understand...
ENOUGH!  He is dead.  You are here for me now.  Michael is gone!
I am your son.  I would not wound you. I could not - ever.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Rowan...?
Do you love me, Michael...?
What about your work back home...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Their what...?
Fall in New Orleans...  This whole town is waterlogged!  The matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
What were you talking about...?
Something's wrong with you.
I - I...  I can't, Michael.  There's stuff --- at the clinic -
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
'Leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' Didn't your father ever teach you that...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
Is that a crack about our singing...?
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Papers...?
The one on the left - definitely...
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
I shouldn't say this - but you really remind me of someone I know
I lost the touch
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
How long have you been watching me?
Tell me about your wife...
My wife  My wife was the only one who really deserved it.  LESLIE do this. LESLIE do that. LESLIE it's your fault... She used to tell me what to wear, where to go, what to do - she mothered me...
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
What's wrong?
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to shout...
Come on, bro. Spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...
Then there must be a whole room, made completely of chocolate.
No, leave one. Somebody's grandmother might want one.
You go first.
Yeah? You like?
Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?"
Sweetheart, what is it?
You have to understand. This was a big shock, for all of us. One minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. The next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.
We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous...  We...uh...we understand your disappointment.
Of course we are.
Son.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Whatever helps you cope.
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Who exactly ARE you?
Teddy? I was thinking.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
This is humiliating. We're being ejected from a prom!
Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you!
No problem, consider it done.  I had this idea of shooting on location. Outdoors, you know? Maybe at some famous Xenia landmarks. You think that would be a problem?
Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.
I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up.
My legacy.
So, what brings you here at his hour?
It's not up to me.
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
That's a crappy thing to say.
Go ahead. Ask her to the prom. Get it over with.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
Just because someone died and made you king of the publishing world doesn't mean you're even one ounce smarter than you were a week ago.
Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps?
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
Is this an gritty exposé or a candy ass press release?
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
Well? What do you think of her?
Charlie's right. Jealousy is so unattractive.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.
He cared enough to want you to have it.
He phoned it in.
In a word: MERK. EXPOSED.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?
No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
You don't have to work another day in your lives.
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
I told you you could do it.
I would have been laughed right out of Xenia.
I never finished school myself. Never had to. My brother built this empire from nothing but his wife's perky tits and a whole lot of gumption. He gave me a cushy job on a silver platter. I never struggled for a second.
I can't wait to see the pictures.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.
People pay good money for that?
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
Gator can't see what's in front of it for shit.  They see out the sides.  That one don't even know Walter's arm's in his mouth.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?
About Suzie?
Actually, I was wondering if I might ask you about Ray Duquette.
She had it, before she drank herself to death.  Wasn't exactly a love child...
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
No.  I've done it a couple of times, I mean with guys I dated.  But this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
You mean he withdrew...
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
I thought of that.  Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo.  Your reputation is getting trashed.  You want to stop the bleeding.  You don't want to sit in jail for three months.  Unless...
So what about the girls?  Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother?  Surely her father...
Ray, you heard him...
That doesn't make him a child rapist.  There's something else.  This girl's had some problems.  Wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  Ran away...
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
You heard Kelly say "Sam."  That was Lombardo on the phone.  And you saw the girls...
Kelly's next, Gloria.
Yeah... okay... he did
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
I said he did.
This wasn't my idea.
What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
You and Suzie used to come out here together?
What are you looking at?
I would hardly say you look like trash.
Jesus.  Well, I do too, sometimes...
Okay, try me on Sunday.  I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday.  You guys can wash the mud off.
How much?
Why can't you come...
Hello.
Kelly... Relax.  Take one of your mom's valium or something.  In another week you get on the plane.  It's over.  We're rich.
That's not your line.
Good.  So what we're going to do is march right to Hunter's doorstep.  We're going to insist they take a statement. We're going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  They're walking a fine line here. Defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
Davy.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
I had to go look for this coupon.
The one you bought at school.
Hey, what did you want me to do, die?
Sam...
Yeah, right.
I was worried about you, Suzie.  I decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
What?
Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
Shit. Here we go again.
Congratulations.  Unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and I really must insist you disembark.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
No offense, but all I ever need...  Are these...  And this.
Aha!
Starting with a screw?
Now, what was that?
What was all that back there?
Come on, let's at least see if we can find Dr. Pemberton.
It's better than nothing.
What's this?
And people are actually fooled by that?
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
Pull the balloon right in front of him!  We'll board the damn thing!
A new friend?
I could get used to this, looking down on people.
Please do.  I'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
But what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  Unless it were a foreign power.
We find ourselves at the dawn of the Golden Age of Science.  And it is the God-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.
You're not going to use it, are you?
He's no magician.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Are you okay?
What's that?  I hear something!
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh?  I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I was in love once, Willow.  She had a hold on my heart.  I could barely function.  I *was* a great swordsman!  I was knighted!  I could have been king!
I'll help you...!
You?
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
I don't know, Willow.
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
Take your time.  Don't worry about the elves.  They won't come out here.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
Is it them?
Oh, he's good.
Yeah.
Who else knows?
Just us.
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Now what's the problem?
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
No, no doctor...
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Tell him his tea stinks.
Enjoying your reading?
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Buttons are Hochmut.
The... bullets?
Sure.
Won him over just like that.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
You're so sure of that?
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Did you find him?
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
That has no place in this house.
That is idle talk.
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
I wish dawdie was with us.
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Oh, we dream lots of silly things when we --
...have you come back?
...resourceful!
Yes, I'm ready now.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
No, they won't - honestly.
Auntie Em was even going to let them kill Toto yesterday for biting Miss Gulch. Oh, please, Professor, why can't we go with you and see all the Crowned Heads of Europe?
...her face is careworn.
...room --
Well, suppose the Wizard wouldn't get me one when we got there?
Oh! They're - they're gone now.
Oh, my!
I'll be home in time for supper!
Are you gonna stand around And let 'em fill us full of horror?
...yes.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Why, it's a man!  A man made out of tin!
Leave her alone!
You stay out of this, Glinda, or I'll fix you as well!
Who at?
Somebody pulled my tail.
Here --   Come on.
And you're going to lead us.
Yes, you.
From now on, we're on enemy ground. You should have something to protect yourself with.
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 
Mr. Gale!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
Ohhhh -- yes...yes, sir -- Y-Yes, your Honor.  You see, a while back, we were walking down the Yellow Brick Road, and --
Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
It's a whozis.
Now, now, don't fret.
It makes you nervous?
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
You new?
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, Ive heard them all.
Couldnt make it. Splitting headache.
So who are you?
Elektra King.
Zukovsky...
I love Christmas in Turkey.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Im sorry.
Its not the pin your father wore. Its an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
I have to check the upper lines.  Gabor will drive you back.
I cant stay here.
I cant stay.
...what?
He used your exact words.
All this, because you fell for Renard?
You turned Renard.
If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
Now...where were we?
Wheres the sub going?!
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Mother of God.
Why are you like this?  Because Bond is dead?  Its what you wanted.
Everythings under control up here.  Are you ready?
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
A whore fucking.
Blake?  Dead?
Because --
It's a tachyon chamber.  It generates subatomic particles which flow backward in time.  There are other worlds, Daniel, other timelines -- existing parallel to our own --
Your problem, Dan, is a lack of vision.  You spent all those years chasing after muggers, and drug dealers, and jaywalkers . . . as if the world was any better for it.  As if any of it mattered.
Damn straight!  We were heroes.
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
No wonder Adrian's rich.  You use that stuff?
. . . What?
I'm an open target, Dan.  If you're with me --
Antarctica??
What are you up to?
They're following us.
Missed 'em Dan.  You're aiming high!
Obvious pattern -- all ties in --
Coward.  Giving up.
Nothing wrong with ketchup.
Did you know he was back on the streets?
What does this mean?  What does it --
Jon??  You mean he's --
Adrian.
Don't rub it in.  I live here.
Too important for telephone.  Comedian -- Dr. Manhattan.  All linked up.
What is this place?
It's your lucky day. You just might get the chance to pay back our wonderful country for all the freedom you enjoy.
Look at me, dude, do I look like a fan of law enforcement? Forget the tests, you shoulda just asked me. I woulda saved you a lot of trouble.
Is that a fact?
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period.
How will you fix it?
If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely.
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
This guy's kinda dorky lookin'.
Sure. Just chisel some off your heart.
If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing?
Yorgi asked me to.
You do everything Yorgi says?
It's a long story, but yeah, more or less.
That's alright, I'll figure something out.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me.
Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been?
Did you do your homework?
What are you doing?
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our.
What's the deal?
Very nice. I'm impressed.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb.  He had the energy source. He had the vacuum.  But he didn't have the filament.  He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
What's wrong with him?
Are you all right?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
Jean... can you?
Inspiring -- Now what am I doing here?
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York.  Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Whatever you do to me... no matter what you'll make me right.  Every word I have spoken will be confirmed.
What am I doing here?
He helped you?
Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
Still happy you married me?
Darling!...you will be careful!?
Of course.
Whatever makes you happy.
Surprised!
Ready, darling?
That's a tough choice.
This is the only library I know of.
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
How long will this whole thing take?
All right then, I suppose I owe the family that much.  You'll have everything ready for me when I arrive?
In conclusion... it should be noted that more than common injury to the nerve roots is always serious, because... once a nerve fibber is severed... there is no way to regenerate life back into it.  Are there any more questions before we leave?
A piece of what?
But, sir...
And do you also say Fro dereck?
There wolf!  There castle!
Did you hear that strange music??
What?
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
I'm getting excited just thinking about it.  What if he's not there?
Ayegor!  Find out where that music is coming from as quietly and as blindingly fast as you can.
No!  The only hope now is to get him back here.  If I can just find a way to relieve the pressure on his cerebellum...
There's only one way.
Come on, big fellow!
Get the sedative ready!
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
Could I lie down in your bed for a little while?  I just can't sleep.
Well...
Let me come with you, Doctor, please!  I don't want to stay up here alone.
Soon, all the electrical secrets of Heaven shall be mine.
What?
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Are you ready for me?
Sweetheart.....Is this really you???
You can't expect to iron out all the kinks in one night.
1 saw you lead our Cavalry sir
Excellent. Thank you.  Give them to Crealock, would you?
Yes. I see you've issued each of them with a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.
Well that one. The one who keeps looking at me.
Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to create difficulties. 45
